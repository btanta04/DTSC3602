https://www.outseer.com/blog/aspen-report-a-national-strategy-to-prevent-scams,Aspen Report: A National Strategy to Prevent Scams,"Consumer scams are escalating into a national security and economic crisis. In response, the Aspen Institute has issued a landmark report outlining a comprehensive national scam prevention strategy, calling for a whole-of-ecosystem approach across government, industry, and civil society.

The report emphasizes that effective scam prevention requires close coordination between the U.S. government, state authorities, and private sector leaders to share intelligence, strengthen defenses, and disrupt organized fraud networks.

In this article, fraud prevention expert, Ken Palla covers:

An overview of the Aspen Institute’s new recommendations on national scam prevention and why they matter.

The U.S. government’s role in leading a coordinated anti-scam strategy.

State and local responsibilities for scam prevention training and victim support.

Private sector obligations to detect and report scam activity, including banks, telecoms, and digital platforms.

The need for a national “duty of care” framework and safe harbor provisions.

Examples of early industry action, including initiatives by AARP, Visa, and major banks.

Why a whole-of-ecosystem approach to scam prevention is essential to protect consumers and restore trust.

The Aspen Institute has released recommendations on fighting consumer scams in the U.S. This initiative will drive the U.S. government and the private sector to take serious action to help fight consumer scams. Consumer scams are a national security threat, and the U.S. needs to aggressively fight this threat.

For my foreign fraud fighter friends, many of these recommendations will be applicable for your country as well. In some cases, these recommendations have already been successfully deployed in several countries.

This report was the result of thousands of hours of work, with over 300 experts from 80 organizations meeting over the past year. The report contains 47 principle-based recommendations and over 100 practical next steps.

Goal of the Recommendations

The goal of these recommendations is to create a “national anti-scam strategy (that) should help strengthen defenses in sectors that scammers target or exploit, including telecommunications, messaging, digital platforms (social media, paid advertising, and retail), and financial services (banking, payments, fintech, crypto).”

The Aspen Institute acknowledges that consumer scams are a U.S. national security threat because of who the scammers are—organized crime, Mexican cartels, Triad gangs—and the amount of money stolen per year. Reported losses exceed $16 billion annually but are likely significantly underreported.

Key Recommendations:

Congress and the White House should recognize scams as a national security threat.

Corporate leaders must act decisively to suppress scam activity at every stage of its lifecycle. This includes maintaining robust anti-scam policies and detecting and disrupting scams in process.

There should be active data information sharing, tracking, and measurement of consumer scams.

Role of the U.S. Government to Lead a National Anti-Scam Strategy

The recommendations put heavy emphasis on the U.S. government to “elevate scam prevention as a national priority” and to establish a national strategy to combat consumer scams.

The government is also being asked to help shut down the criminal organizations that perpetrate these scams. This will require cross-border coordination with many countries. Several nations are already participating in coordinated efforts to eliminate scam centers and related criminal organizations.

The U.S. government is further asked to facilitate scam data sharing between the various organizations that should be fighting consumer scams. Currently, there are limitations to sharing data among banks, telcos, digital platforms, and law enforcement. Cross-sector data sharing is a critical component of this anti-scam strategy.

Missing National Consumer Duty of Care

The Aspen Institute recognizes, “There is no clear or consistent national ‘duty of care’ to suppress scam activity across sectors targeted by scammers, such as telecommunications, messaging, digital platforms (social media, paid advertising, and retail), and financial services (banking, payments, fintech, crypto).”

According to the Aspen report, this needs to change to “establish clearer duties for companies to prevent scam activity, coupled with an improved set of rights (safe harbors) and authorities that enable them to act decisively.”

The U.S. government can address this through regulation, or companies can add voluntary anti-scam strategies and controls. Certain safe harbor provisions to support this “duty of care” would, however, typically require government regulation or legislation.

Role of States and Local Governments

The states are pivotal in the fight against consumer scams. They need trained and “scam-focused” law enforcement to be able to interact with consumers when they report crimes and ask for help in recovering stolen funds.

Too often, local police are not trained in consumer scams. Not every local police department has the resources to be the primary contact.

This is where states need to define overall law enforcement training and offer a triage approach for victims in smaller counties. For example, a state the size of Montana, with just over one million people, might have one center with experts to support consumer victims.

See Table 1 for some of the key recommendations.

Role of the Private Sector

Telcos, digital platforms, and banks are where scammers use their facilities—text messages, dating site interactions, bogus investment ads, and money movement—to execute scams.

The Aspen report acknowledges this and recommends that these sectors adopt a formal anti-scam policy and strategy. It also strongly recommends “know your customer” controls to prevent scammers from:

Sending scam text messages to consumers

Interacting with unsuspecting members of dating sites

Selling goods on marketplaces

Posting scam investment ads

Creating money mule accounts (the receiving side of a scam transaction)

There are additional controls mentioned for each sector. Some of these are included in Table 1.

When the report discusses states and the private sector, there is a clear emphasis on scam prevention.

Table 1. Key Recommended Actions by Sector

What Action Is Occurring in the Private Sector?

For the Aspen Institute’s recommendations to have real impact, the U.S. government, states, and the private sector must commit to these requirements and demonstrate measurable action.

Axios reported several positive developments this year:

“AARP stood up a new Fraud Watch Network earlier this year, which offers a free helpline for people who have been targeted by scams and connects them with law enforcement as needed.”

“Visa, another member, created its own internal scam detection practice this year that proactively hunts and takes down scams on its own payment networks and beyond.”

Some banks have also established dedicated anti-scam departments focused solely on consumer scams. Others have begun tracking scam incidents to raise executive-level awareness of the problem.

The call to action is clear: the private sector must become fully engaged in fighting consumer scams, beginning at the CEO level.

Closing: Urgent Action is Required

The consumer scam problem is massive in the U.S. and around the world. The Global Anti-Scam Alliance estimates worldwide losses may reach $1 trillion. These scams are driven by transnational organized crime, including large scam compounds in Southeast Asia with 100,000 to 300,000 scammers.

This requires urgent action:

The U.S. government needs to treat this as a national security issue and establish national leadership to fight consumer scams.

The government must work to disrupt scam operations.

Regulation and legislation should require banks, telcos, and digital platforms to have anti-scam policies and strategies in place. Cross-sector data sharing should be enabled, with proper safe harbor protections for reasonable actions taken by these sectors.

States must increase law enforcement support to address consumer scams and make AAMVA data available across all states. Crypto ATMs should be banned.

Banks, credit unions, fintechs, telcos, and digital platforms need to establish anti-scam strategies with meaningful controls that can reduce consumer scams.

We need a whole-of-ecosystem approach to fight consumer scams and protect American consumers. The private sector can begin taking action now while federal and state governments determine their roles.

After all, it is private sector customers who are being scammed and losing billions. A lack of serious private sector action could shift the issue from prevention to regulatory liability considerations.

Next Steps

For those seeking to go deeper, read the Consumer Scam Controls whitepaper that I developed alongside Outseer. This is a valuable resource to help you benchmark your organization and improve your response to consumer scam prevention."
https://www.outseer.com/blog/why-outseer-has-behavioral-biometrics,Why Outseer has Behavioral Biometrics: A Strategic Signal for Improving Fraud Detection,"We’ve been talking about the Outseer Behavioral Biometric product openly, but what has not been shared is the rationale for why we have chosen to develop this capability.

Obviously, any new product must have a tangible value to customers; there must be a return on investment to implementing it—both in terms of reducing total fraud losses but also improving operational efficiency.

Visualizing the Attacker Methodology

Behavioral Biometrics has emerged over the past 10 years as one of the most desirable components in a digital fraud management framework. The key value is that for the first time, defenders are able to envisage what the attackers are doing—not just at the device level but looking behind the device.

It allows fraud fighters to get into the mindset of thinking like the attacker—as a ‘Red Team’—by using the data points to illustrate intent and motive behind the digital journey interactions.

Pivoting of the Threat Landscape

Over the same time period, the fraud threat landscape has shifted on its axis—unauthorized fraud where the fraudster manipulates the customer account has been overtaken by authorized fraud where the customer themselves is manipulated.

Within Outseer, we are evolving ourselves, taking existing proven controls and enhancing them with machine learning and new signals. GenAI is accelerating the capabilities of fraudsters, which results in banks demanding improvements. To our mind, Behavioral Biometrics is just a signal—on its own it does not solve all problems—but it definitely brings unique insights which are otherwise missing.

Signal vs Noise Simplified

Risk engines need more data points that are specific to newer attack types, and that is what Behavioral Biometrics really delivers. By linking it into the context of the transaction (payee and value, current and historic), the device intel, and data from other channels, you bring down false positives.

Being able to do this natively in a single platform—without implementing a point solution—is how banks are now thinking, as they look to simplify vendor management and integration.

Identifying Earlier and Interdicting

Behavioral Biometrics is useful in identifying scams where the victim is guided in real time via the phone—it is very good at authenticating that it is the genuine customer making the payments, but also that they are acting atypically with signs of coercion. Layering it with signals such as active phone call and a new payee for a large amount improves accuracy.

Future developments based around behavioral insights look to be able to break the spell earlier before the payment. Subtle nuances in behavioral changes can be queried and context-based questions asked which seek to break the spell of the customer. Outseer is developing this as we speak, linking into the Behavioral Biometrics insights.

Regulations Catching Up with Innovation

The other reason for introducing Behavioral Biometrics is that of Regulatory Compliance—particularly for authentication in regions where Stronger Customer Authentication (SCA) is mandated. Behavior can prove it is the real user behind the device and simplify authentication journeys such as 3DS challenges by removing the need for a password. Other jurisdictions such as Malaysia are explicitly asking for client behavioral analysis in their regulations, and we expect this trend to continue to grow over time.

Reimagining the Platform

So, we’ve covered the value from a fraud and authentication perspective, and how Behavioral Biometrics helps solve the challenges that financial institution fraud teams face. From an Outseer perspective, it proves how we are evolving, with a lot of investment behind the scenes on people and machine learning capability. Behavioral Biometrics is just the first of the more visible enhancements we’re undertaking to enhance our platform.

End-to-End Capability That Is Integrated and Affordable

The Outseer fraud prevention platform gives cross-channel capability (Digital Banking and 3DS Cards) alongside intel about attacker activity in FraudAction. Behavioral Biometrics can be rapidly deployed for existing customers in a cost-effective manner and can also be linked with other signals.

Some scam types will not be stopped by just looking at the behaviors on the victim accounts—we need to look more at where the money is ending up. Our next capability is money mule detection by using transactional, non-transactional, and Behavioral Biometrics to detect risks across organizations.

Constant Improvement in the Face of Organized Adversaries

Our goal is to keep improving—to build on the heritage and scalability of our platform—and to demonstrate we understand the challenges financial institutions now face. Fraud has emerged as a critical threat to national security globally due to the scale of losses now seen.

Organized transnational crime groups dominate and, in some cases, are linked to Nation State or Terrorist sponsors. At Outseer, we strive to give a better view of risk across the entire fraud landscape for the sake of maintaining trust in digital channels."
https://www.outseer.com/blog/why-data-sharing-is-the-key-to-stopping-scams,Why Data Sharing Is the Key to Stopping Scams,"Ken Palla has written an extensive whitepaper for Outseer looking at the state of data sharing worldwide for fraud prevention and how increasing amounts of it are happening alongside legislative changes.

In the whitepaper, he looks at what constitutes global best practices for data sharing and the mechanisms behind it—with, unsurprisingly, the UK being highlighted as one of the leaders. But why is data sharing so important for fraud—particularly in dealing with scams?

I want to draw on my own experiences around this; being a Brit I know firsthand the benefits of data sharing from my time working in a bank (much like Ken did). I helped create a cyber intelligence function within a bank many years ago and coordinated data sharing calls and mailing lists with my peers.

When I first began sharing intelligence with other banks, they were hesitant. From their perspective, why should I reveal the scale of attacks I was facing or the techniques being used? It seemed like I was giving them an advantage. Proactively showing them how to prevent fraud before it reached them.

At first, it did feel one-sided. But once trust developed, the dynamic changed. As soon as one bank shared intel back, the exchange became balanced. When multiple banks began contributing, the value multiplied. Each piece of intelligence built on the last, making the collective defense far stronger than anything we could achieve alone.

This is the thing about data sharing—it is the power of the network; by providing and receiving back information you all get benefit. But in my experience, there are some things that are needed for it to work:

Trust – Sharing only to people or organizations you trust

Mutualism – All participants need to contribute, not just consume

Actionable – Intelligence must be specific and usable, not just informational

Relevance – Must be appropriate to the group – or it cannot be used

Timely – Share as soon as possible, or else the value is minimized

Start small – Identity the initial usable data which can be shared

The main thing to think about when we look at data sharing is that fraud, and especially now Scams, cannot be stopped by just a single entity. The attack chain extends across many industries, including tech companies, telcos, banks and crypto. Data sharing highlights the true cost of the problem as well as helps reduce fraud losses.

There is the need for data sharing organizations at both a local and international level. There are established groups already, such as CIFAS in the UK who focus on fraud, FS-ISAC who have experience from the infosec space, and GASA who have acted strategically with their Global Signal Exchange (GSE).

Other important sharing organsiations can be vendor led like Outseer’s Global Data Network. Proof of concept data sharing between industries such as banks and telcos, or tech companies, work across the Attack Chain.

Even within a single organization, data from one area of the bank can be successfully shared with other parts; the best example of this is the move over the past two years to take digital data from the fraud area of the bank and use it in the financial crime areas. Money mule detection has been the first recipient of this successful sharing, with a wider perspective of money launderers coming next.

The positive news from Ken’s summary of global data sharing is it is becoming easier; there are less legal impediments to data sharing now. At the end of 2024, the UK Information Commissioners Office stated that a reluctance to share personal information to tackle scams and fraud can amount to a failure to protect their users from harm!

Asia is probably the most dynamic area for data sharing legislation, especially around looking for money mules. In Europe, GDPR is rightly, or wrongly, viewed as an impediment to fraud detection (although changes are happening).

Ken has done a great job of not only showing how and where data sharing is happening but created a blueprint for what best-in-class looks like. This paper acts as a reference which can be used to influence senior stakeholders to undertake more sharing—helping protect consumers.

https://www.outseer.com/blog/how-banks-and-nations-can-stop-scams,How Banks and Nations Can Stop Scams: A Framework for Coordinated Defense,"A Growing National Security Threat

Scams are no longer just a banking issue—they’re a growing national security threat. While banks have invested heavily in controls, fraudsters are evolving faster. Outseer's latest whitepaper, Consumer Scam Controls, which I co-authored with Ken Palla, outlines a coordinated framework to stop scams across the entire ecosystem.

The UK was the first country in the world to flag scams as a National Security Threat, which led to controls being deployed earlier. Other countries are now having the same realization, and forging forward with new perspectives on the problem.

What Does Great Look Like?

Due to the rapidly evolving nature of the attacks, it can be difficult to know what detection mechanisms best work together. These issues are fundamental to all fraud fighters, whether in a financial institution or elsewhere, and there is a need for a list of best practices to benchmark themselves against.

Ten Key Learnings

1. Controls are effective at different parts of the Scam

The whitepaper includes a Scam Attack Chain which looks at five different stages. We cover not just the transaction, but what happens before and after it.

2. Regulated or Legislative Controls

Government or regulator mandated controls give a level playing field. Customers are less likely to be disadvantaged dependent on their choice of bank.

3. Reimbursement

Reimbursement is not necessarily the answer, as Australia has shown a whole ecosystem approach means all parties involved improve. The UK has financial institutions reimburse putting the onus on banks and losses have not declined as much.

4. The Earlier the Better

To reduce the volume of attacks controls need to be effective earlier in the chain before the scam itself. Telcos, tech companies and social media need to improve as well as the banks.

5. English Speaking World Led Controls But Has Fallen Behind

UK and Australia originally took the lead in controls due to scam attacks. Asia is now rapidly catching up and exceeding them with innovative controls.

6. Intelligence is the Key

Data sharing is needed to improve controls learning from when scams get through. Learn what goes wrong and share actionable intelligence (see our Data Sharing whitepaper on this).

7. Some Areas Need to Do Better

The USA and Europe are lagging in controls compared to the leaders. Their citizens are disadvantaged and losing the most money.

8. One Size Does Not Fit All

Controls now need to consider customer demographics in a digital age. Elderly or vulnerable customers end up more at risk due to them not being experienced in the channel.

9. The AI Arms Race is Real

AI is being used by the attackers, with GenAI being widely deployed with deepfake images, voice and videos. Defenders need to make full use of AI in their controls to counter this industrialization.

10. Co-Ordination Gives Better Capability

National Anti-Scam centers will speed up country level responses by bringing together all parties. Global capability via industry associations (e.g., GSMA), global tech companies (e.g., Google) and scam specific organizations (e.g., GASA).

Failure to Respond Means Tragic Consequences

We’re building this list into a living resource for Fraud Leaders. There are emerging capabilities, especially in crypto, to recover the stolen monies that have not been documented yet.

Inaction at any point in the Attack Chain means the bad guys win, and people will continue to fall victims to the epidemic of attacks that currently shows no sign of slowing down. At Outseer we are building on our heritage with new novel capabilities being developed; we see the human side of fraud as the next challenge to focus on, with AI already changing the world as we know it faster than anyone expected.

https://www.outseer.com/blog/following-the-fraud-new-research-about-money-mule-networks,Following the Fraud: What New UK Research Reveals About Money Mule Networks,"Why Money Mules Are a National Security Threat

The stark role that money mules play in undermining the UK digital economy has been highlighted in research by the Royal United Services Industry (RUSI), using data from Lloyds bank. They draw on previous comments they made about fraud (which makes up 40%+ of UK reported crime) being a ânational security threat.â

This research is one of the first times a forensic lens has been applied to where money goes when it leaves a mule account. Until now, the focus has been identifying mule accounts via the money going into themÂ â something which the UK PSR regulations last year forced most UK banks to concentrate on.

How Money Moves: Faster Payments, Cards, and Cash

This study looked at two monthsâ worth of data in 2024 analyzing the outflows of money from identified mules. The outcome of this is revealing:

There isnât much surprise that Faster Payments was the preferred choice, but this figure is probably down compared to 2023 as this is when UK banks started to focus on money mule detection.

The Oversized Role of Digital Banks and Payment Providers

However, when we look at the faster payments there was a concentration of funds going to newer digital banks or payment platforms (who might not have invested as much in mule detection):

It is known that some payment companies have been providing virtual IBANs and it is probable that they were abused in some of these cases. It shows their controls are not as mature as established banks.

Cards as a Cashout

Looking at the debit cards more trends can be seen:

From a card and 3DS perspective it highlights how increased data sharing between channels in banks is needed; being able to take insights from digital banking into risk scoring for card use (and vice versa) is going to grow over time.

Mule Account Ages

Looking at the age of the mulesâ accounts gives insights into how well an established bank is detecting mules:

This differs to other banks where Outseer has been co-creating our mule detection; with them newer accounts being used moreÂ â the âComplicitâ mules from the FBI definition. At Lloyds it appears more âWittingâ mules where accounts go from good to bad, either due to people needing money or selling on accounts without appreciating the consequences.

The Speed of Cashouts

The last metric of interest is the speed of money movement:

It shows how Faster Payments equals Faster Fraud! The operational capabilities behind the money mule network should not be underestimated, these are organized criminal networks and they know how exploit financial systems.

Unanswered Questions

One thing that wasnât referenced to was Open BankingÂ â it is known to be used in some scams to pull money into mule accounts, but there seems to be no usage of it to move money onwards from them. For scams it is being used as there is less awareness of it and not mentioned much in customer education.

Another unanswered question is what happens to the cashÂ â does that go back into other accounts, or is it used in a similar way to debit cards to transfer money overseas via money transfer companies? Or it is being deposited into crypto ATMsÂ â it is common in the USA for scam victims to directly deposit into them. The only way to get more intel on this tracking and arresting a mule as he has the cash.

The Wider Money Laundering Issue

One thing is for certainÂ â this stolen money is being concentrated elsewhere as part of a money laundering process (the final integration stage). Whether this is happening within the UK or overseas is unknown.

Also, Mules are not just used for APP scam cashoutsÂ â they are needed for all forms of financial crime as they are actually low-level money laundering. As RUSI says we need to better understand the end-to-end flow of money in mulesÂ â not just spotting the mule account.

Final Thoughts

As the UK took the lead on mule detection, this shows how financial institutions must now go beyond that and collaborate on outflow analysis. The next phase of fraud defense will be defined by cross-bank intelligence and real-time data sharing. Outseer continues to lead with our mule detection development that looks at both inward and outward payments."
https://www.outseer.com/blog/money-mule-accounts-we-need-to-shut-them-down,Money Mule Accounts: We Need to Shut Them Down,"This article is about money mules in the UK, but it is probably representative of any country. So, listen up. Money mules are one of the biggest reasons that transnational organized crime is successful in account takeovers (unauthorized transaction) and consumer scams (authorized transactions). Banks, credit unions, fintechs, and Banking-as-a Service solutions are generally weak when it comes to detecting, blocking and removing money mules. And in some countries, in the interest of preventing debanking of the vulnerable and the young, money mule accounts are not even shut down.

In August, the

Financial Times

reported: âMore than 225,000 people (in the UK) were identified as âmoney mulesâ for letting criminals use their accounts to launder funds last yearâ. The FT story went on to report: âThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it recognized the scale of the challenge in tacking the fast-growing problem of money mules and their pivotal role in enabling the rise of fraud (in the UK)âwhich rose to a record

45 percent of all UK crime

in the year to March.â The FCA also said the âlargest UK banks closed 226,957 money mule accounts . . . up from 184,935 a year earlier.â

And with all of these closures, there are probably still hundreds of thousands of undetected money mule accounts waiting to receive/move fraud and scam money.

To help provide more analysis to this issue of money mule accounts, the UKâs Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) just released a report,

Following the Fraud: The Role of Money Mules

. Â The authors, Kathryn Westmore and Allison Owen, were given money mule data by Lloyds Bank from June 17 2024 â August 11 2024 for this analysis. The data is based on money mule accounts at Lloyds Bank.

One of the first things that was identified was that as the money left the Lloydsâ money mule accounts, the money transferred to a few other financial institutions. In fact, RUSI reported: â38% of the payments by total value went to just three banks/ payment firms, with 20% of all payments by total value going to one single firm. This firm also received the highest number of payments from money mule accounts. These three institutions can be characterized as

digital financial institutions

, offering banking and money transfer services via apps and online banking.â Â RUSI also reported that that âover 450 (10%) of the payments identified from mule accounts went to Banking-as-a-Service providersâa disproportionate share compared with the overall share of Faster Payments to these services.â

In 2024, the

Payment Systems Regulator

detected a similar issue with a concentration of money mule accounts in smaller receiving banks and payment firms and also more activity in certain larger receiving banks (directed PSPs) in 2022â23. Charts 1 and 2 show the PSR assessment. Note: non-directed PSPs are smaller financial organizations.

The PSR

September 2024 consultation document

also showed âthat non-directed PSPs accounted for just over 8% of all Faster Payments made in 2023, but received 53% of all fraudulent transactions,â There has not been an update by the PSR since 2024, but it seems clear that some financial institutions may be still be weak at eliminating money mule accounts.

An obvious issue with the bank customer becoming complicit in making accounts available for money muling is highlighted by this quote in the Financial Times article. Ben Donaldson, managing director for economic crime at UK Finance said âmany money mules were tricked or coerced into it without knowing it is a crime for which they can be imprisoned, even though few are convicted. I donât think we can say all mules are victims but certainly many mules are victims.â

So, there are two key issues: 1) a certain number of banks need to be much better at detecting money mule accounts, and 2) how to deal with customers (maybe the young and foolish, maybe victims of scams themselves, and maybe those looking for fast money) who make their accounts available.

The RUSI report also identified the age of the mule accounts, which supports the âselling of accountsâ. â20% of known money mule accounts were older than five years, with the majority (about 60%) being older than one year.â The âolderâ aspect of these money mule accounts is symptomatic of the current customers selling the use of their accounts. This can make it more difficult to detect money mule accounts.

Another interesting observation is the short amount of time the money stays in the money mule account. The RUSI study showed: ânearly 28% left the account within 15 minutes and a further 25% left within an hour. Less than 15% of the money remained within the accounts after 24 hours.â This highlights the need for strong anomaly detection on inbound transactions so that suspicious money mule transactions can be identified and a hold can be quickly placed on the account to prevent the funds from moving. The UK has laws that allow suspicious transactions to be held. Other countries may need to add such âimmediate holdâ laws.

Part of the money mule control should also be looking at fast exfiltration from the account. The RUSI report shows money can exfiltrate from the money mule account via transfer to another bank account, via ATM cash withdrawal and via debit card transaction. Figure 1 from the RUSI report contains detail of the exfiltration activity.

Another interesting point is the large amount of small dollar transactions exfiltrating from the money mule account. The average payment amount was Â£532. And the average debit card transaction was Â£107. This is consistent with reports that one-quarter to one-third of APP scam losses are less than Â£100. These small amounts will be more difficult/problematic for anomaly detection systems to pick up.

Actions to Take from the RUSI Money Mule Study

This report can help a financial institution undertake a strong money mule management program. Â Here are some of the key data points to take into account when building this program.

A special thanks to Lloyds Bank and RUSI for providing the money mule data and the analysis. It helps to provide some keen insight to money mule accounts and the associated money movement. An interesting follow up for RUSI would be to analyze how long a money mule account was active and how many times it was used as a money mule account before it was shut down. This report also highlights how if there was more data sharing between financial institutions, we could help to weaken the value of money mules as a way to stop account takeovers and scams."
https://www.outseer.com/blog/consumer-scams-the-right-way-to-train-your-staff,Consumer Scams: The Right Way to Train Your Staff,"There is much discussion around the severe threat of consumer Scams. This is transnational organized crime, driven by massive scam compounds in southeast Asia. Victims are psychologically groomed to transfer millions of dollars. Banks, telcos and digital platforms all must implement controls to help prevent these Scams from occurring.

Detecting the Scam Is Only the Start of the Battle

The Scam controls have already been covered in the

whitepaper

I wroteâand what gets less attention is what happens after detection.Â For example, Banks might alert on a suspicious transaction such as:

The spotlight is now turned on the Bank employee who talk with the customer and they must:

This final step is the moment when all of the Scam controls will bear fruit or collapse.

The Psychology of Why People Believe in the Scammers

In August I had a chance to talk with two Canadian psychologists who specialize in Scam Prevention. Kelly Peters (Behavioural Economics Leader and Partner) and Michelle Hilscher, PhD (Senior Manager, â¨Behavioural Economics) work in Deloitteâs Behavioral Economics Group in Toronto, and many thanks to the Canadian Bankers Association for the introduction.

Kelly and Michelle talked about how to train bank staff for when they interact with customers who appear to be Scam Victims. The goal is to prevent the Scam monies from leaving the bank and saving the customer from loss.

Kelly reminded me that people know the right thing to do. But life injects itself at times with emotion, pain, grief, pressure, loneliness and shame, among other 'runaway trainâ events.Â It is during these events that Scammers will be most successful as the customer is vulnerable

When I asked how bank staff should respond to a Scam alert, Kelly said:

She pointed out Scammers effectively exploit psychological factors that Bank staff often overlook when dealing with clients.

The SAFETY Framework

Kelly defined the framework used by Scammers as the SAFETY Framework.

How Can Bank Staff Break the Spell of the Scammers

Michelle then gave specifics on how Bank staff should interact with a customer in the branch or on the phone. If they spot a suspicious transaction (wire, cash withdrawal)Â she advised:

Is Focusing on Customer Liability a Workable Option?

Kelly was asked about giving the customer a Withdrawal Alert Warning Form to sign. The form would include samples of Scam scenarios and warning the customer is fully liable for the loss, with a space for the customer signature.

She said this could have unintended consequences.

She suggested a better way to address this would be to give the customer an interactive prompt instead:

Is there a Best Way to Train Bank Staff?

Kelly and Michelle said that proper staff training is important for staff morale. When staff have these interactions, they feel defeat when they cannot retain the money in the bank and the customer remains a victim. Better training will get a better success rate â the transaction cancelled and customer saved. So, better training is as much for the benefit of the staff themselves as well as the customer.

They emphasized that finding the best approach for each customer interactions will take trial and error, just like how the Scammer worked to master the best grooming pitch. Try, fail, try again in training, not when dealing with real customers

Michelle focused on measuring the success of the training using role playing:

Key Points Any Interaction With a Scam Victim Needs To Consider

In closing I asked Michelle and Kelly what are a few quick pointers for Bank staff, ahead of any training. She said:

Kelly said it is important for banks to realize that:

Final Thoughts

I really enjoyed interviewing Kelly Peters and Michelle Hilscherâit reinforced for me that staff training should be the number one Scam control for banks.Â But to be successful it really needs to be covering the psychology of:

I know many Banks (and of course credit unions and fintechs) are paying much more attention on fighting consumer Scams. I hope this brief article helps frame the importance of effective staff training to help keep the funds for the customer. Bank staff are the first responders for consumer Scams. Make them count!

https://www.outseer.com/blog/protecting-payments-is-expanding-the-identity-life-cycle,Protecting Payments is Expanding the Identity Life Cycle,"The popularity of instant payments capabilities is growing around the world. Outseer has seen increases of 55% to 70% in mule activity, account takeover (ATO) activity, and authorized push payment (APP) fraud related to instant payments. (2024 Outseer Global Fraud & Scams Trends Report, pg. 20) Real-time payment fraud has been identified by fraud professionals as one of the top two fraud vectors in the US, Asia-Pacific, and Europe. (2025 Global eCommerce Payments & Fraud Report, p. 24, fig. 22) With the growth in scam losses and attention brought to scams, financial institutions, money service businesses, and telecommunications companies can expect to shoulder increased blame. (ACFE Fraud Magazine, Jan 2025)

And the fight is no longer about good guys and bad guys. There is a growing grey area. Visa has documented a staggering 244% increase in synthetic identities used in applications based on forged documents. (FinTech Magazine, May 2025)

Oh, no, this is not another blog post that regurgitates the depth of the fraud problem, is it?!

Well, yes and no. (Guilty as charged . . .) Above you’ve been provided with some helpful resources that should provide ample fodder for internal project justification. But the point here is to get us all in the same head space as we look to “force multipliers” in the fight against fraud.

Identity is a potential area to explore to find such a force multiplier in the fight against fraud. As Kay Turner with FinCEN says, “to get financial services right, we have to get identity right.” (Biometric Update, Feb 2024)

In order to turn identity into a force multiplier in the fight against fraud, perhaps we need some adjustments to the way we think about identities and their relationship to payments. There was a time that given a 3.5″ floppy drive and knowledge of an account number, you could login to access online services for that account. We have made significant progress on two fronts since then: 1) we have the ability to do much better binding of a digital credential to the proper human being; and 2) once we establish the digital credential, we have a much more robust toolbox of authenticators. Yes, we still have the challenge over “security vs. convenience,” but the tool box is well stocked.

So why are these fraud numbers continuing to grow? We have continued to play whack-a-mole with the fraudsters as we add hurdles to services (either onboarding or transactional).

I had a board member who used to say “you can fool anything anytime, but you can’t fool everything every time.” (RIP, Jim Woodhill) How can we take this premise and apply it to fraud fighting?

Think of the way we treat digital identity is a series of ladders. There is a ladder of activity we put a consumer through to get an account. Then there is another ladder we put them through to establish digital access. There might be another ladder we put them through to complete transactions (looking at you, 3DS2!). These ladders are placed in different locations, use different approaches, and likely do not share experience data.

So what if we shifted from thinking of the identity process as a series of ladders, to using the analogy of a conveyor belt. Better yet, an infinity torus! Identity is not something that we “establish,” then move on to the next step. We must be constantly challenging the assumptions we’ve made and share information across the identity life cycle.

But wait, what about customer experience, you say. Perhaps by treating identity as an something that needs ongoing grooming, we can actually create BETTER user experiences. One problem with the “ladders” is they are different processes using different terminology and different user interfaces. A continuous identity handling process presents an opportunity to unify experiences (and share experience information along the way). Another problem is the “point-in-time” nature of many identity management processes, the customer can be put through more rigorous challenges on occasion. And that occasion seems to always fall at an inconvenient time!

Perhaps the greatest benefit of a continuous identity life cycle is that we get a very complete view of who a user is by how they behave. As the advent of scams has made clear, financial institutions and payment service providers are being asked to “do something” to help protect customers. It turns out that the one thing we have a very hard time figuring out is the “intent” of a payment. If the right person with the right credentials wants to send money, our default is to send the money. Developing ways to understand the intent of a payment can give fraud fighters signals that will slow a customer down. In fact, many jurisdictions are passing rules to explicitly allow FIs to slow down payments when a scam is suspected. (AARP, Dec 2024)

How do you start on the road to continuous authentication? The first step is to break down the silos between teams responsible for AML/KYC, identity, authentication, and fraud. There is much common ground already, but continuous authentication requires a deeper level of cooperation. It is likely that these teams, when presented with the continuous conveyor belt theory of identity management, would be excited to participate!"
https://www.outseer.com/blog/new-nist-identity-proofing-and-authentication-bible-out,New NIST Identity Proofing and Authentication âBibleâ Out,"In August 2025, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has come out with its new standards around authentication and identity proofing. In NISTâs own words:

âThese guidelines cover the identity proofing, authentication, and federation of users (e.g., employees, contractors, or private individuals) who interact with government information systems over networks.â

If you are a fraud fighter in any country, this is your go to document to understand the latest in guidance around identity proofing and authentication. NIST has been putting out these documents for several decades. It is probably the best open source for obtaining this unbiased information. NIST is often the first one to call out issues with existing identity proofing and authentication controls. Although these guidance documents are released maybe only every four years, they are packed with the âwhysâ something must change.

The Four Documents

The first document is

NIST SP 800-63-4 Digital Identity Guidelines

. This document âdescribes the digital identity models, risk assessment methodologies and processes for selecting assurance levels for identity proofing, authentication and federation.â

The second document is

NIST SP 800-63A-4 Identity Proofing and Enrollment

. This document provides ârequirements for identity proofing and the remote or in-person enrolment of applicants.â This includes details on the Identity Assurance Levels (IAL) which are used to âconvey the degree of confidence that the subjectâs

claimed identity

is their

real identity

.â

The third document is

NIST SP 800-63B-4 Authentication and Authenticator Management

. This document provides ârequirements for authentication processes that can be used at each of the three AALs (Authentication Assurance Levels), including choice of authenticators.â The AALs levels describe the strength of the authentication.

The fourth document is

NIST SP 800-63C-4 Federation and Assertions

. This document provides the ârequirements on the use of federated identity architectures.â This is more for âthe conveyance of identity and authentication information across a set of networked systems.â Unless you are focused on networked systems, you do not need to read this document.

Why is Identity Proofing and Authentication So Important in 2025?

Most financial institutions are using identity proofing and authentication solutions that can be 5â15 years old. Massive new threats to identity proofing and authentication have been introduced by the fraudsters, often sophisticated organized crime or even nation-states. Just think of the new fraudster capabilities from GenAI in the past two years, including agent bots, ability to generate good counterfeit driverâs licenses and passports, ability to defeat liveness testing, better social engineering, etc. Some of these new threats include bypassing multi-factor authentication. In fact, in the UK, the Royal United Services Institute

considers

âfraud as a national security concern.â A critical amount of fraud originates around weak identity proofing and authentication.

These new threats can make your identity proofing and authentication control stack quite weak.

To select new identity proofing and authentication controls requires a solid framework to help assess what are the critical requirements to mitigate the existing threats. The NIST documents really help solve this need. It took a while for me to find these âback in the dayâ, but once I did, they stayed by my side. It helped to explain to management why our current controls needed updating and the risk if we did not update. As an example, NIST was the first security entity to say stop using OTP email (very insecure) and really consider upgrading away from OTP email (too easy to spoof and the telecom environment was never meant for authentication security). Most financial institutions, and many others, still use OTP, even with these warnings.

What are Examples of What Is Contained in These NIST Guidelines

To help you understand the value of the documents, I will include several really good examples of what you will find in these documents.

There is a really good section on threats to identity proofing which include

This section contains examples of these threats and suggested mitigations. Section 3.14 of 800.63A discusses a critical attack vector mitigation, the Presentation Attack Detection (PAD). PAD is automated determination of a presentation attack which interferes with the operation of the biometrics identity proofing.

There is a section of fraud checks that should take place, including:

When confirmation codes are used as part of validating enrollment data, the document provides specifics to the length (minimum 6 digits numeric) and when the code should expire (based on how the code is delivered -e.g. 10 minutes if sent to a validated phone)

There is a section that addresses customer experience to ensure the identity process does not cause customer experience issues.

For beginners, the document explains the basics of authenticators:

It cautions that a biometric cannot be used by itself for authentication.

The document explains cryptographic keys and how they can be used. This is a critical component with FIDO authenticators (also discussed in this document).

You often hear of the need for a âphishing-resistantâ authenticator to help mitigate phishing attacks and credential theft. Well, Section 3.2.5 of 800-63B will help you understand what âphishing-resistant â means and how to make sure you add this control as part of your authenticator solutions.

There is a good section describing Authenticator Assurance Levels (AAL). First is the definition of the three levels:

There is a description of the suggested authenticators for each level and why there may be different levels, even in the same application. See table from the NIST guidance.

This detailed discussion of Authenticator Assurance Levels and types of authenticators is especially important for EU financial institutions assessing how they will comply with the upcoming PSD3 regulations. Also,

articles

on PSD3 discuss how financial institutions must include consideration for the vulnerable : â(Strong Customer Authentication) SCA methods must now include authentication ways for vulnerable customers such as the elderly or people with disabilities who donât rely solely on smartphone access.â

There is a good description of a very detailed point called âsyncable authenticatorsâ. This where the customer wants to copy the authenticator secret to additional devices. This can be key for customer usability.

There is another good discussion on considering offering multiple authenticators for your customer base. âOne-sizeâ authenticator for all customers is no longer a best practice. One key point is to âconsider authenticators from the usersâ perspective.â

The NIST standards also bring up the important point of âcontinuous session monitoring.â Section 5.3 of 800-63B talks about the characteristics that can be included, such as behavioral biometrics, device and browser characteristics, usage patterns and velocity.

There is also a threat section on authenticator risks, including device theft, phishing, social engineering, authentication fatigue, unauthorized binding and device sold with keys included.

Final Thoughts

This is a free set of security documents from the US government. It is your primer education on identity proofing and authentication for financial institutions, eCommerce, and more. Read them at your own pace. Print them off and highlight and mark them up. It will be like an old novel you really liked. Or maybe that college textbook that was so well written, it really got you through the course. Your course today is to protect your FI and your customersâand this course does not end. So, buckle up and make the 2025 NIST identity proofing and authentication guidance your new best friend. Enjoy and this will help keep your FI and your customers stay safe."
https://www.outseer.com/blog/new-zealand-government-established-anti-scam-alliance,New Zealand Government Established Anti-Scam Alliance,"On July 10, 2025, The New Zealand government

announced

the creation of the New Zealand Anti-scam Alliance. Â This comes on the heels of the New Zealand Bankers Association

announcement

in April 2025 âupdating the Code of Banking Practice for the countries banks to better protect customers from scammers.â Â According to the government press release, Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Scott Simpson says:

âUp until this point New Zealandâs anti-scam efforts have developed in an ad-hoc way and suffered from a lack of coordination. We frequently hear that real-time information on scams is sourced from different areas across government and the private sector, making for a fragmented, and often, slow response.

âThe Alliance addresses this by establishing a formal structure for government agencies, banks, telecommunications companies, digital platforms sectors, and consumer groups to share data about scams and shut them down in real-time.â

The Alliance issued its first

report

. Â Within the report, the Alliance listed four key objectives:

With collaboration, the plan is to increase data sharing between the public and private sector. Â Following the Australian Financial Crimes Exchange (AFCX) model would be a good start. Â Maybe they could share part of the AFCX structure. Â Plus, this objective focuses on better coordination between the members.

With disruption, the Alliance wants to âtackle scammers at scale by uniting national efforts across and between Government, law enforcement, not-for-profit organizations, regulators and the private sector.â Â The Alliance also wants to engage with key international organizations.

With education and awareness, the Alliance wants to help businesses educate consumers. And also provide direct education to consumers.

With voluntary codes, the government wants the industry bodies to establish âvoluntary sector codes which set standards for the prevention, detection of and response to scams

.â

The report showed a list of current members and where they will participate.

The Alliance will finalize its work plan by December 2025.

So, how well will this Alliance work? Â It will take a âstrong handâ by the New Zealand government to make this Alliance effective. Â Singapore and the UK governments come to minds as best examples of governments, with a âstrong and firm handâ, driving the scam loss curve down (yes, Singapore scam losses rose in 2024, but it was a small number of large losses that caused the increase in scam losses). These governments, including their regulators, have effectively required banks to add critical controls to help reduce consumer scams. Â The UK also has the Online Safety Act legislation for digital platforms and Singapore added telco controls, along with bank controls, to reduce phishing losses. Â Can the New Zealand government match that action?

New Zealand has chosen a non-legislative approach to solve the consumer scam problem. Â The banks, telcos and digital platforms need to add controls to prevent 1) scams from starting and 2) stop the money leaving the financial institution. Â To stop the scams from starting requires digital platforms to quickly remove any bogus ads and websites. Â The digital platforms need to better vet their customers. Â Dating sites need a real KYC effort to remove scammers.

To stop the money leaving the financial institution, the New Zealand banks need more than their current five voluntary scam controls. Â As an example, the banks need to commit to strong money mule management and have strong controls around account opening. All of these controls do not need to be part of the banksâ existing voluntary scam reimbursement program. Â Put in strong controls to reduce consumer scams independent of reimbursement.

Effective data sharing amongst the participants in imperative. Â Singapore is one to follow with its COSMIC data sharing program. Â Maybe the GASA Global Signal Exchange can help in New Zealand. Â And of course, the Australian AFCX program should be looked at.

From a consumer side in New Zealand, there is already concern about the short list of voluntary bank controls to help reduce consumer scams. Â I asked Janine Starkes, consumer advocate and writer for two New Zealand newspapers, what she thought of the new Alliance. Â She said: âNew Zealand is infamous in the local market for the protection of Aussie banks, allowing them to write their own rules and avoid liability in key areas (such as receiving bank scam liability). The scam alliance is an extension of this.â Â She also added: âThis alliance stands in stark contrast to our Australian neighbors who have mandates and fines â the same banks operate in both markets.â

This Alliance needs to show it is serious about reducing scams. Â That means causing some pain for banks, telcos and digital platforms in order to get really meaningful controls.

The New Zealand

Post

said: âThe Government has unveiled a public-private âallianceâ to fight scams, and among its aims is to get Apple, Discord, Google, Meta, Snap, TikTok, Twitch, X and Yahoo to sign up to a voluntary anti-scam code.â Â The government has to prove it can get these digital platforms on board.

Final Thoughts

I want the New Zealand model to be a winning model. It has the potential to be one of the best. Â Part of my measure of the Allianceâs success will be consumer groups saying scam losses are dropping and the banks, telecoms digital platforms are making a difference in this fight. We are up against transnational organized crime and we have to fight back tough. I thought Singapore hit hard with its recent âif we think the customer is in a scam, just block their account.â That is a hammer, but the customer still has his money. Some customers wonât like that. There will also be things banks, telcos and digital platforms wonât like, if the New Zealand government manages the Alliance correctly. And that is ok. We need to save our consumers from losing their life savings. We need to play hard ball! Maybe New Zealanders would say âKia Kaha.â Go Kiwis!!"
https://www.outseer.com/blog/us-senators-take-action-on-consumer-and-commercial-online-scams,US Senators Take Action on Consumer and Commercial Online Scams,"The Proposal

On June 12, 2025, four US senators came together to

announce plans

to fight consumer and commercial online scams in the United States. Senators Mike Crapo, an Idaho Republican, and Senator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat were joined by Senators Jerry Moran, a Kansas Republican, and Raphael Warnock, a Democrat from Georgia, to propose a task force. These senators are proposing a bill to establish the Taskforce for Recognizing and Averting Payment Scams Act or the TRAPS Act.

The goals of the bill are:

The task force will be chaired by the US Treasury with a variety of members with key backgrounds to help identify and mitigate the problem of both consumer and business scams. Some of the members would include representatives from government (including the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, the Department of Justice, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the National Credit Union Administration, The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation), banking, a credit union, a digital payment network, a consumer group and a technology or an industry representative from online platforms.

The bill proposes the task force undertake several key activities, including but not limited to:

The key outcome of the bill will be for the Taskforce, within one year, to report to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives:

Why is This Important?

The US is woefully behind in fighting online scams. The FBI IC3 recently provided the

2024 scam loss numbers

at $16.6 billion. And these are just reported losses. These scams include impersonation scams, romance scams, investment scams and business/vendor/real-estate email compromise scams.

Elder losses were over $4.8 billion with an average elderly loss of over $83,000. And elder losses increased 43% from 2023. These losses are financially and emotionally devastating.

If you include unreported losses, the number could exceed over $160 billion in 2024. The reported losses alone are increasing about 33% per year.

Most of these crimes start with a telephone call, a text message (or WhatsApp/Instagram message), someone meeting a criminal on social media/dating site, or involvement with a bogus ad or investment web site. Then the victim is psychologically groomed over time to send money via the banking payment rails. Sometimes, the scam can be much more immediate (we have kidnapped your granddaughter, your son caused an accident, or the help desk scam).

What is most important to understand is the criminals are international organized crime groups. And the monies stolen are used for drug trafficking, terrorism, weapons creation, human trafficking and more. This requires a national response to tackle these crimes.

What Are Other Countries Doing?

Several countries have done a better job at addressing consumer scams. The UK began in 2019 to require banks to have scam controls. The major UK banks also voluntarily began to reimburse Authorized Push Payment (APP) scam losses. Then in 2023, the regulators required banks add money mule controls. In 2024, new government legislation required banks to reimburse for consumer scam losses up Â£85,000.

In Australia, in 2023, the Australian Banking Association introduced the voluntary Scam-Safe Accord where banks agreed to create a scam strategy and add scam controls. In 2025, Australia passed the Scam Prevention Framework (SPF). The SPF will require banks, telcos and digital platforms to have scam controls and if they are not properly deployed, could require reimbursement for consumer scams. The SPF will go into effect in 2026.

Other countries, including Singapore, Thailand, New Zealand and the Philippines have added strong scam controls and requiring consumer reimbursement in certain circumstances. Singapore includes banks (and telcos in some cases), while Thailand involves banks, telcos and digital platforms (similar to Australia).

What Will Be the Outcome?

This Taskforce needs to create the urgency for the US government to act, but also banks, telcos and digital platforms need to step up with controls to help prevent these crimes.

It is also important to remember the Aspen Institute has an initiative underway to address consumer scams. This involves some of the same potential members the Taskforce will have. And the Aspen Institute will have a report out in late September.

Closing Thoughts

Although quite late, it is great to see these four senators come together in a bipartisan way to help fight online scams. We can learn a lot from the programs other countries have already initiated.

There are many proven solutions from around the world that can be applied to help banks, telcos and digital platforms fight these scams. Bogus online investment web sites and ads must be taken down. There must be proper KYC for dating sites and social media customers to help identify and remove criminals.

The US government needs to lead this fight. Government leadership has been absolutely essential for the success we see in these other countries.

A successful program must also eradicate the large scam compounds around the world, with pressure put on countries to shut these compounds down. Law enforcement must be funded to fight the other criminals physically in the US and other countries. The FBI, US Secret Service, Interpol and other international law enforcement agencies must continue to work together to arrest these criminals.

We also need education on consumer scams and support for the victims of these crimes.

Many trade associations and consumers groups, including the American Bankers Association, AARP and the Electronic Transactions Association, support this legislation.

It is never too late to do the right thing. Letâs go America."
https://www.outseer.com/blog/uk-finance-2024-app-scam-statistics,UK Finance 2024 APP Scam Statistics,"UK Finance 2024 APP Scam Statistics Shows Changing Scammer Tactics and the Need for Telcos and Digital Platforms to Join the Fight

In late May 2025, UK Finance produced its annual

report

on unauthorized and authorized fraud in the UK for the year 2024. This blog will focus on the authorized transaction activity, known as Authorized Push Payments (APP). The one caveat to the UK Finance data is that it only comes from the 33 contributing members of UK Finance; however, this this includes all of the large banks. This makes it difficult to compare the data to say Australiaâs recent scam loss data for 2024, where the scam data comes from Australian government sources. Plus, most of the UK Finance data is from Faster Payments, which is where most of the scams occur in the UK.

As a result, it will be hard to say if one country is doing better than another. What we can clearly say is that the effort in the UK, with strong bank scam controls and money mule controls, along with consumer reimbursement up to Â£85,000, is working to contain consumer scams. As we will see later, the APP scam numbers did not drop very much, as I had hoped for in 2024.

Assessment of the Results

APP scam fraud, as reported by UK Finance shows losses flattening out (only down 2%) from 2023 to 2024. Table 1 shows the scam details from 2020â2024. In reviewing these statistics, remember that mandatory scam reimbursement began October 7, 2024. So, for the final three months of 2024, the reimbursement should have been at about 90% of the scam losses. Yet, these statistics show that although scam losses went from Â£459.7 million in 2023 down to Â£450.7 million in 2024, reimbursement dropped from Â£287.3 million in 2023 to Â£267.1 million in 2024, whereas reimbursement should have risen with the new mandate.

The reimbursement rate in 2024, including the three months under mandatory reimbursement, was 59.2%. The reimbursement rate in 2023, with only voluntary reimbursement from the large UK banks, was higher at 62%. When we look at the May 2025

report

from the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR), they only showed reimbursement of Â£27 million for the first three months of the reimbursement program (October 7 2024âJanuary 7 2025) at an 86% reimbursement rate for this period. For a three month period, this should have probably been a higher amount of reimbursement, given the UK Finance 2024 APP scam loss number of Â£450.7 for all of 2024. The PSR report did not include the total scam losses for this 3 month period.

The PSR did report that the volume of APP claims during that 3 month period were lower than expected, providing early feedback that there was not a rush of first party fraud.

I would have expected the total value of gross scam losses to have been materially lower in 2024, given all of the scam controls and money mule controls required of payment service providers. As an offset, we know the scammers are using GenAI to create better impersonation scams, romance scams, and investment scams.

Table 1: 2024 APP Scam Cases

One scam that did increase in amount is the investment scam. This is becoming a real problem around the world. Table 2 shows the growth in investment scams, up 34% in 2024. The average loss for an investment scam is always higher than other scam losses. The average investment loss in 2024 was Â£18,500.

Table 2: 2024 APP Investment Scams

One scam category that declined in amount is the romance scam. Table three shows the value of romance scams dropped 17%. The hope here is that strong consumer education has helped to lower these losses.

Table 3: 2024 APP Romance Scams

Impersonation scams dropped for both âPolice/Bankâ and âOtherâ (e.g. utility company) impersonations. âPolice/Bankâ dropped by 16% and âOtherâ by 38% in 2024.

Table 4: 2024 APP Impersonation Police/Bank Staff Scams

Table 5: 2024 APP Impersonation Other Scams

The report has a key table, Payment Type, that shows the payment types the scam transactions used. As expected, this shows Faster Payments has the bulk of the scam activity, at 78% in 2024. Faster Payments used to be as high as 96% of APP scams.

Both intrabank transfers and International payment types, neither covered by the reimbursement program (although the Payment Systems Regulator informally requests payment service providers to reimburse intrabank transfers), grew in 2024, for a total of 12.4% of scam payments. Both effectively doubled in 2024. International payments are almost Â£50 million. It will be interesting to see if the scammers pivot to payment types that are not covered by reimbursement, thinking banks will not have as much protection for non-reimbursement transactions. See Table 6 for the details.

Table 6: 2024 APP Payment Types

What is still so troubling is the fact that most of these consumer scams start as a telephone call/text message or from the digital platforms. The report lists the source of these scams:

It is difficult to get these other players to participate in helping to reduce scams. There is some progress, especially when there is regulation forcing action. We see this in Australia with the Scam Prevention Framework. There is the Online Safety Act in the UK, but penalties have not yet kick in. Even Vietnam has a new regulation that holds banks, telcos and digital platforms accountable for adding scam prevention controls or be liable for scam losses.

Other Activities in the UK That Helps Reduce Scams

The UK has a number âwhole-of-ecosystemâ controls that help fight scams. The report mentioned several:

Closing

So what do the 2024 UK APP scam statistics mean?

The UK is containing scam losses, but not effectively decreasing them. This has been accomplished by strong regulatory requirements around consumer scam controls and money mule controls. Plus, a mandatory reimbursement program to reimburse for most APP scams that mainly use the domestic faster payment rail.

The UK Finance report stated: âthere is nothing to suggest it (the mandatory reimbursement) has had any impact on the perpetrators. If anything, it may have resulted in them focusing more on international payments (no reimbursement for international payments).â This is probably true, but what they fail to say is that the mandatory reimbursement is one of the key drivers for banks and payment service providers to have very strong scam controls and money mule management.

Reimbursement, along with the regulations around scam controls and money mule management, helped create the scam controls business cases for UK banks. As an example, as we look at the US, there is no regulation for scam controls and money mule management, and no reimbursement, and as a result, many financial institutions do not do much to help reduce consumer scams. And the US consumer scam losses skyrocket.

It is troubling to see investment scams, with higher losses, growing. And with the surge of crypto currency being the new âsure thingâ investment, we will see more losses.

Equally troubling is the power of GenAI. New releases by various vendors of their Large Language Models (LLMs) show revolutionary power to create video from just a picture and make the video speak in many languages with real-time interactive translation between the scammer and the victim. And now with Google new VEO 3 video LLM, video is not just goodâit is great. Scammers will use these new capabilities to convince the victim they are the âpersonâ they claim to be.

Without strong controls and training, investment and romance scams will grow.

The elephant in the room is the digital platforms and telcos, who do not come close to pulling their weight in the fight against consumer scams (and that is also true for many banks outside the UK). Yes, they are doing some things. But we need bogus investment scam ads and websites taken down quickly. We need policing of consumer marketplaces to remove fraudsters. Dating sites need âbankâ level verification of members. Telcos need a better way to prevent scam text messages from getting to consumers. They need to better prevent fraudulent international calls. All banks around the world need to follow the UK example of scam controls and money mule management. These consumer scams are starting to impact bank safety and soundness!

The UK banks and payment service providers have very strong incentives to prevent scam losses from growing and hopefully force a meaningful downturn in the scam loss numbers. And they are succeeding to a degree. But this UK Finance report shows how hard it is without all the affected parties (banks, telcos, digital platforms, governments and the consumer) joining in the fight against what is truly transnational organized crime. Only then can we bend the scam curve down.

What is most interesting is how cleanly the IC3 breaks out the fraud data for analysis. So, letâs unpack this report. Chart 1 contains the crime type categories by dollars lost.

Investment scams, at $6.6 billion have shot to the top, almost doubled since 2022. Business Email Compromises (BEC) have leveled off for the past three years at $2.8 billion, but still high given this fraud category began around 2011. Companies just donât learn.

Tech Support scams are up $500 million since 2023 to $1.464 billion and have risen almost 87% since 2022.

Confidence Fraud/Romance is up slightly since 2023 but down 9% since 2022. This is probably down, with the big increase in pig butchering (a combination of romance and investment) probably included under investment fraud.

A few other interesting loss numbers:

Every age group is getting scammed. This is consistent with some recent information I received from a US bank which confirmed that all age segments are successfully being attacked by the scammers. The additional point they made was the vast majority of the losses were suffered by the elderly.

Chart 2 shows the numbers of scams and dollar losses by age group. You can see in the chart the number of reported incidents was fairly evenly spilt between the age groups. The last three age groups suffer the most because that is where more wealth has been built up.

This year the FBI IC3 report has a special section on elderly fraud losses. It is important that the report has a special section on elderly fraud losses, as the losses per incident are much higher for the elderly and they have no time or ability to recoup these losses. These losses can be financially and emotionally devastating. The key elderly loss statistics are in Chart 3.

The elderly lost $4.9 billion in 2023. The average reported loss for the elderly is now $83,000

. These may be the most important statistics in this report. And 7500 complainants lost over $100,000. Also, there was a

43% increase in losses from 2023 for the elderly

. This is a very disturbing trend.

In another section of the report, there is more breakdown of top elderly dollar losses by crime types: Investment losses for elderly were $1.8 billion, Tech Support was $900 million, Confidence/Romance was almost $400 million and government impersonation over $200 million. Cryptocurrency was involved in $2.8 billion of the fraud (58%).

It is exciting to see the newly established National Elder Fraud Coordination Center (NEFCC) open this month, just as the IC3 report was released. One of the primary goals of the NEFCC is to bring the criminals who attack the elderly to justice. Watch for important results as this year unfolds.

When the fraudsters commit the fraud/scams, there are several key ways the money moves. Chart 4 shows this.

Notice how cryptocurrency and wire transfers lead the money outflow, with cryptocurrency the number one way. Some states are now limiting the daily crypto ATM deposit limit to $1000. This daily limit should be law in every state. Also, these statistics put financial institutions on call to add strong controls to prevent money mules. This includes strengthening account opening controls and having inbound transaction monitoring.

The report also breaks out losses by state. Chart 5 shows the top states by complaints and number of losses.

With the slow death of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), I think these state fraud loss numbers could become the catalyst for states to take action to require scam prevention from banks, telcos and digital platforms to help protect their constituents. Certainly, California and New York, two states with strong legislatures and existing strong consumer laws, could step up to help protect their constituents. In fact, in March, the California Senate held a hearing on Consumer Scams.

The 2024 Report also included several techniques the FBI deploys to recover losses and to prevent losses. The first technique is the Financial Fraud Kill Chain. According to the report: âthe IC3 Recovery Asset Team streamlines communications with financial institutions and FBI field offices to assist in the freezing of funds for victims of fraudulent domestic and international transactions via the Financial Fraud Kill Chain. Most Financial Fraud Kill Chain incidents initiated by the IC3 RAT are Business Email Compromise (BEC). The Financial Fraud Kill Chain can also be initiated for Tech Support Fraud, Romance Scams, and Data Breaches.â Chart 6 show a five-year history of the Financial Fraud Kill Chain

The second technique is Operation Level Up. The report says: âLaunched in January 2024, Operation Level identified victims of cryptocurrency investment fraud and notified them of the scam. Operation Level Up notifies victims while the scam is in process. The operation was initiated with the support of agents from FBI and the U.S. Secret Service.â This primarily has involved crypto currency investment frauds, known as pig butchering. Below are the results:

Utilizing IC3 complaint data, Operation Level Up reported:

The third technique involved shutting down scam call centers. The report went on to say: âSince 2022, the DOJ, FBI, and IC3 have collaborated with law enforcement in India, such as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in New Delhi and local Indian states, to combat cyber-enabled financial crimes and transnational call center fraud.â The success of this technique is shown below:

Unfortunately, many of the very large scam call center/compounds are in lawless Myanmar and will be difficult to shut down. China has had limited success shutting down some scam compounds in Myanmar. Other scam compounds are located in Cambodia, Laos, the Philippines, parts of the Middle East and Latin America.

Conclusion

The FBI IC3 2024 Internet Crime Report echoes what we saw in the recent Federal Trade Commission (FTC) 2024 Sentinel Report. Both reports showed about a 25â33% increase in fraud from 2023. The dollar range between the two reports is $12.5â$16.6 in annual reported fraud.

Perhaps the most disturbing statistics were from the elderly age group.

We definitely need to provide better protection for the elderly to prevent these crimes.

Use of cryptocurrency in the reported losses exploded from $3.8 billion in 2023 to $9.3 billion in 2024.

This is a 250% increase in 2024.

And the largest age group with cryptocurrency losses was the elderly at $2.8 billion.

Since maybe only 5â10% of fraud losses are reported, we can estimate total fraud losses at $150â200 billion per year in the US. These are stunning numbers!

Even with these massive loss numbers, the US still has no national strategy to combat consumer scams, which make up a large portion of these losses. Why is a national strategy/attack plan so crucial? Because the scammers are no longer just individuals. It is transnational organized crime attacking individual consumers, picking them off one by one. The UN and Operation Shamrock have identified massive scam compounds in Southeast East Asia (and elsewhere) with hundreds of thousands of scammers with the sole focus of stealing money from consumers in almost every country in the world.

There is another ominous threat for the US. With several English-speaking countries actively deploying scam prevention controls (the UK, Australia and New Zealand), the scammers will put more emphasis on the US, a country that has no requirements for scam controls or money mule controls. So, expect the numbers to grow in 2025.

There are, however, two potential bright spots in the US. In April 2025, the National Elder Fraud Coordination Center (NEFCC) opened in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. CEO Brady Finta, former FBI Supervisory Special Agent, is putting together a team to work with law enforcement and private sector companies to help aggregate elder Individual fraud cases into large cases and go after the criminals. This is patterned after the successful San Diego Elder Justice Task Force.

The second initiative is the

Aspen Institute National Task Force for Fraud & Scam Prevention

. This task force includes financial institutions, digital platforms, telcos, consumer non-profits and the US government. The goal of this task force is to define actionable solutions to prevent fraud and scams in the US. These solutions will be announced in Q4 2025.

But now, US financial institutions, where the money leaves the scam victim accounts, need to do more. They should follow the lead of the UK, Australian and New Zealand bankers and add a scam strategy with scam controls and money mule controls. Digital platforms that operate in the US need to add the same controls they are already deploying in the UK and Australia. Telcos need to do more to block international scam calls and to block scam text messages. We continue to see a more aggressive telco response in the UK, Europe and Australia.

Also, more states should have laws that 1) allow banks to hold suspicious transactions involving elderly customers with a safe harbor for banks and 2) have daily limits on crypto ATM deposits and 3) require elderly bank customers to name a âtrusted personâ for banks to notify for suspicious transactions.

We can make a difference in the US, but it requires a whole-of-ecosystem response with individual entities and government committed to actional solutions to fight these scams."
