research reveals about money mule networks new rusi research with lloyds data reveals how money mule accounts move millions through faster payments and digital banks and why better cross bank data sharing is critical why money mules are a national security threat the stark role that money mules play in undermining the uk digital economy has been highlighted in research by the royal united services industry rusi using data from lloyds bank they draw on previous comments they made about fraud which makes up of uk reported crime being a national security threat this research is one of the first times a forensic lens has been applied to where money goes when it leaves a mule account until now the focus has been identifying mule accounts via the money going into them something which the uk psr regulations last year forced most uk banks to concentrate on how money moves faster payments cards and cash this study looked at two months worth of data in analyzing the outflows of money from identified mules the outcome of this is revealing m was moved from mule accounts mostly sent by faster payments next most common was debit cards then cash via atm or branches there isn t much surprise that faster payments was the preferred choice but this figure is probably down compared to as this is when uk banks started to focus on money mule detection the oversized role of digital banks and payment providers however when we look at the faster payments there was a concentration of funds going to newer digital banks or payment platforms who might not have invested as much in mule detection to three payment providers digital banks i e not a traditional financial institution actually went to a single provider it is known that some payment companies have been providing virtual ibans and it is probable that they were abused in some of these cases it shows their controls are not as mature as established banks cards as a cashout looking at the debit cards more trends can be seen high value large amounts to a particular retailer typical buying goods that command a high resale value such as technology items or watches smaller value but higher volume payments to money transfer foreign exchange or crypto exchanges a lot of mundane spending on food drink taxis average payment from a card and ds perspective it highlights how increased data sharing between channels in banks is needed being able to take insights from digital banking into risk scoring for card use and vice versa is going to grow over time mule account ages looking at the age of the mules accounts gives insights into how well an established bank is detecting mules of mules were older than five years the majority are older than one year this differs to other banks where outseer has been co creating our mule detection with them newer accounts being used more the complicit mules from the fbi definition at lloyds it appears more witting mules where accounts go from good to bad either due to people needing money or selling on accounts without appreciating the consequences the speed of cashouts the last metric of interest is the speed of money movement often money left the mule account in less than mins over half of funds moved within an hour less than let in mule account after hours it shows how faster payments equals faster fraud the operational capabilities behind the money mule network should not be underestimated these are organized criminal networks and they know how exploit financial systems unanswered questions one thing that wasn t referenced to was open banking it is known to be used in some scams to pull money into mule accounts but there seems to be no usage of it to move money onwards from them for scams it is being used as there is less awareness of it and not mentioned much in customer education another unanswered question is what happens to the cash does that go back into other accounts or is it used in a similar way to debit cards to transfer money overseas via money transfer companies or it is being deposited into crypto atms it is common in the usa for scam victims to directly deposit into them the only way to get more intel on this tracking and arresting a mule as he has the cash the wider money laundering issue one thing is for certain this stolen money is being concentrated elsewhere as part of a money laundering process the final integration stage whether this is happening within the uk or overseas is unknown also mules are not just used for app scam cashouts they are needed for all forms of financial crime as they are actually low level money laundering as rusi says we need to better understand the end to end flow of money in mules not just spotting the mule account final thoughts as the uk took the lead on mule detection this shows how financial institutions must now go beyond that and collaborate on outflow analysis the next phase of fraud defense will be defined by cross bank intelligence and real time data sharing outseer continues to lead with our mule detection development that looks at both inward and outward payments', 'unmasking money mule operations the fight against financial fraud outseer unmasking money mule operations the fight against financial fraud money mule operations are a crucial component of financial fraud you can t rob a bank without a getaway driver in this blog we ll delve into what money mule operations are how fraudsters use them to cash out scammed money and how outseer s cyber intelligence feeds can help financial institutions combat this menace understanding money mule operations money mule operations involve using willing co conspirators or unwitting dupes to facilitate the transfer of illicit funds either the proceeds of scams or thieves or other types of unclean assets these individuals are typically recruited online and may be completely unaware of their involvement in criminal enterprises or they may be the victim of scams themselves promised a chance to recover stolen money recent statistics have shown a sharp increase in the involvement of older victims in money mule activities with a rise in those over acting as money mules however it is crucial to note that naive victims under years old are the most likely demographic to participate the anatomy of a money mule operation recruitment fraudsters recruit money mules through various channels including job listings social media or online forums they entice them with promises of easy money and minimal effort work from home offers or shipping agent offers are some of the most common job covers for money mule operations as highlighted by uk finance money mule recruiters have adapted their tactics during the pandemic by posting fake job advertisements on websites and social media figures reveal a concerning trend with over suspected money mule cases involving to year olds in marking a five percent increase from the previous year money transfer once a money mule is recruited they are instructed to receive funds into their bank accounts or e wallets this money is often stolen from unsuspecting victims cash out the mule s primary role is to withdraw the funds and send them to the fraudsters typically through untraceable methods like cryptocurrency or money transfer services statistics from lloyds banking group reveal that many people are unaware of the possible year prison sentence as punishment for being involved in money mule activities this lack of awareness makes it even more critical for financial institutions and individuals to stay vigilant american federal level law enforcement like the us secret service or fbi assert universal jurisdiction on cases involving us victims us banks or us dollars following extradition participants in money muleing may face a minimum of six months up to and including a possible year sentence the role of cyber intelligence feeds here s where outseer s cyber intelligence feeds come into play these feeds provide invaluable information to financial institutions helping them flag and investigate accounts addresses or emails that are associated with money mule activity this proactive approach is instrumental in the fight against financial fraud uncovering compromised accounts and money laundering in addition to flagging money mule activities outseer s feeds can reveal compromised accounts and connections to money laundering schemes this information is critical for financial institutions looking to protect their assets and reputation cash laundered by money mules is used by criminals to facilitate serious crimes such as terrorism drug trafficking and people smuggling underscoring the far reaching consequences of these illicit activities money mule operations are a key enabler of financial fraud but with the right tools and intelligence financial institutions can fight back outseer s cyber intelligence feeds empower businesses to identify and combat money mule activities ultimately safeguarding their finances and reputation unmasking money mule operations how cyber intelligence combats financial fraud discover the critical role money mule operations play in financial fraud and the pivotal need to combat these schemes join us on jan at pm gmt for an in depth exploration of how cyber intelligence feeds such as those from outseer can empower financial institutions in this fight', 'money mule accounts we need to shut them down outseer money mule accounts we need to shut them down money mules fuel scams and account takeovers uk data shows how banks and fintechs must act faster to detect block and stop money mule accounts this article is about money mules in the uk but it is probably representative of any country so listen up money mules are one of the biggest reasons that transnational organized crime is successful in account takeovers unauthorized transaction and consumer scams authorized transactions banks credit unions fintechs and banking as a service solutions are generally weak when it comes to detecting blocking and removing money mules and in some countries in the interest of preventing debanking of the vulnerable and the young money mule accounts are not even shut down in august the financial times reported more than people in the uk were identified as money mules for letting criminals use their accounts to launder funds last year the ft story went on to report the financial conduct authority fca said it recognized the scale of the challenge in tacking the fast growing problem of money mules and their pivotal role in enabling the rise of fraud in the uk which rose to a record percent of all uk crime in the year to march the fca also said the largest uk banks closed money mule accounts up from a year earlier and with all of these closures there are probably still hundreds of thousands of undetected money mule accounts waiting to receive move fraud and scam money to help provide more analysis to this issue of money mule accounts the uk s royal united services institute rusi just released a report following the fraud the role of money mules the authors kathryn westmore and allison owen were given money mule data by lloyds bank from june august for this analysis the data is based on money mule accounts at lloyds bank one of the first things that was identified was that as the money left the lloyds money mule accounts the money transferred to a few other financial institutions in fact rusi reported of the payments by total value went to just three banks payment firms with of all payments by total value going to one single firm this firm also received the highest number of payments from money mule accounts these three institutions can be characterized as digital financial institutions offering banking and money transfer services via apps and online banking rusi also reported that that over of the payments identified from mule accounts went to banking as a service providers a disproportionate share compared with the overall share of faster payments to these services in the payment systems regulator detected a similar issue with a concentration of money mule accounts in smaller receiving banks and payment firms and also more activity in certain larger receiving banks directed psps in charts and show the psr assessment note non directed psps are smaller financial organizations chart value of app scams received per millions of transactions non directed psps chart value of app scams received per million of transactions directed psps the psr september consultation document also showed that non directed psps accounted for just over of all faster payments made in but received of all fraudulent transactions there has not been an update by the psr since but it seems clear that some financial institutions may be still be weak at eliminating money mule accounts an obvious issue with the bank customer becoming complicit in making accounts available for money muling is highlighted by this quote in the financial times article ben donaldson managing director for economic crime at uk finance said many money mules were tricked or coerced into it without knowing it is a crime for which they can be imprisoned even though few are convicted i don t think we can say all mules are victims but certainly many mules are victims so there are two key issues a certain number of banks need to be much better at detecting money mule accounts and how to deal with customers maybe the young and foolish maybe victims of scams themselves and maybe those looking for fast money who make their accounts available the rusi report also identified the age of the mule accounts which supports the selling of accounts of known money mule accounts were older than five years with the majority about being older than one year the older aspect of these money mule accounts is symptomatic of the current customers selling the use of their accounts this can make it more difficult to detect money mule accounts another interesting observation is the short amount of time the money stays in the money mule account the rusi study showed nearly left the account within minutes and a further left within an hour less than of the money remained within the accounts after hours this highlights the need for strong anomaly detection on inbound transactions so that suspicious money mule transactions can be identified and a hold can be quickly placed on the account to prevent the funds from moving the uk has laws that allow suspicious transactions to be held other countries may need to add such immediate hold laws part of the money mule control should also be looking at fast exfiltration from the account the rusi report shows money can exfiltrate from the money mule account via transfer to another bank account via atm cash withdrawal and via debit card transaction figure from the rusi report contains detail of the exfiltration activity figure share of payments out of money mule accounts by types another interesting point is the large amount of small dollar transactions exfiltrating from the money mule account the average payment amount was and the average debit card transaction was this is consistent with reports that one quarter to one third of app scam losses are less than these small amounts will be more difficult problematic for anomaly detection systems to pick up actions to take from the rusi money mule study this report can help a financial institution undertake a strong money mule management program here are some of the key data points to take into account when building this program any account regardless of the age can be a money mule account current customers are being solicited to share their accounts for a fee when the economy is tough this can be enticing money mule activity is not just about large dollars in fact as this study shows much of the transaction activity is low amounts around how to deal with a high volume of small amounts can make the money mule solution more difficult and a volume of small amount transactions into a mule account may look more normal when analyzing the outbound activity of a suspect account look at receiving bank to see if it is anomalous e g many transactions from multiple accounts going to a new fintech or to a small receiving bank also take into account the other ways to exfiltrate the money wire debit card atm as part of the outbound analysis because the money leaves the money mule account quickly it is important to be able to complete a quick risk assessment of the inbound transactions track and report the accounts the money is transferred to from your bank to the next receiving bank outbound from your money mule account to a new money mule account this is valuable information for fis a special thanks to lloyds bank and rusi for providing the money mule data and the analysis it helps to provide some keen insight to money mule accounts and the associated money movement an interesting follow up for rusi would be to analyze how long a money mule account was active and how many times it was used as a money mule account before it was shut down this report also highlights how if there was more data sharing between financial institutions we could help to weaken the value of money mules as a way to stop account takeovers and scams']"

stop them card not present fraud card not present fraud occurs when a person makes an unauthorized purchase using stolen credit card information without physical access to the card cnp fraud can occur anywhere a merchant cannot inspect the physical card fraudsters typically steal credit card information from phishing scams that trick users into entering their payment information into a cloned version of a trusted site once the victim enters their payment details that information is sent to the fraudsters even when merchants and customers do everything right they can still fall victim to cnp fraud cybercriminals break into legitimate online businesses and steal databases filled with customer payment information card details are often sold on dark web marketplaces where other criminals can try and commit fraud with them during the first three quarters of outseer recovered over million unique compromised credit or debit cards from dark web marketplaces and fraud networks that s roughly compromised cards per day that could otherwise be exploited from criminal gain one of the best ways to protect against cnp fraud is to deploy solutions that leverage the emv d secure protocol which uses shared transaction data and threat intelligence to assign each transaction a risk score e commerce sites can choose how they want to handle riskier transactions with many opting to request additional authentication or blocking blatant fraud altogether ds is one of the most popular forms of e commerce security thanks to its high accuracy and frictionless flow by using over data points ds can root out fraudsters without impacting cardholders shopping experience how to prevent cnp fraud enforce cvv verification on your website implement solutions that use the d secure protocol to block fraudulent purchases use an address verification service chargeback fraud chargeback fraud occurs when a customer makes a purchase with the sole intention of issuing a chargeback and keeping the item when a chargeback occurs the customer is refunded their money and the vendor is charged with a chargeback fee these fees can vary in size and mount up quickly if chargeback fraud is left unchecked sometimes chargeback fraud can happen accidentally like when a customer forgets their subscription for autopay and seeks a chargeback this is known as friendly fraud while friendly fraud may seem innocent enough it still impacts e commerce site owners the same way as it stands now of merchants report experience return abuseof some kind over the past months and say it has been getting worse how to prevent chargeback fraud implement solutions that use the d secure protocol to block fraudulent chargebacks send email confirmations when a product has been purchased have a clear and visible return policy use detailed product descriptions and payment descriptors use shipping insurance or shipping confirmations when possible make issuing a refund through your site simple vs going through the card company account takeover account takeover occurs when a legitimate customer account is hijacked by fraudsters who use that account to steal information and make fraudulent transactions this can be particularly challenging to detect since the login occurs under a trusted account cybercriminals can target large organizations to authorize bank transfers or steal company secrets for ecommerce sites attackers steal customer accounts and abuse their saved payment methods or max out their bnpl credit luckily by comparing known user behavior with new login attempts artificial intelligence can use risk scoring to block sign ins that are highly suspicious how to prevent ato attacks implement frictionless risk based authentication to protect accounts automatically even if the username and password are stolen use multi factor authentication when possible watch out for logins under new devices and locations that don t match typical user behavior account enrollment fraud why take over an account when you can use stolen card information to set up an account or rewards program with an online merchant from scratch using a synthetic identity according to the fbi synthetic identity fraud is a billion problem that the fbi calls one of the fastest growing forms of financial crime synthetic identities can be tough to root out because they use a mix of fraudulent and randomly generated information once a synthetic identity is used attackers can simply create another account and repeat the process in these attacks fraudsters open an account or activate a mobile app using pilfered card information since the new user appears legitimate there is no discrepancy between shipping addresses or contact information helping them bypass most traditional fraud detection systems how to prevent account enrollment fraud require multiple forms of identity proof and running it through external databases deploy solutions that leverage machine learning and identity science

fraud measures include pci compliance ai and machine learning risk based monitoring and more thanks in part to the dramatic shift to online shopping during the covid pandemic e commerce fraud could cost online merchants as much as billion for the full year according to juniper research and it s easy to see why from a criminal perspective it s a low risk high value proposition in the past fraudsters would have to physically steal credit and cards and use them in brick and mortar stores or over the phone today they can easily and inexpensively acquire stolen card details and other credentials through dark web marketplaces this level of convenience combined with multiple layers of anonymity makes e commerce fraud extremely attractive to cybercriminals types of ecommerce fraud over the years fraud has evolved beyond simply exploiting stolen cardholder data today criminals have many ways to carry out e commerce fraud with some being much harder to detect and prevent than others here s a look at a few of the most common forms of e commerce fraud cnp fraud card not present cnp fraud occurs when a criminal makes an illicit purchase without physical possession of the payment card almost all e commerce sites require a card verification value cvv to prove card ownership but that s not always enough as mentioned crooks gain access to full card details through dark web marketplaces they also steal this information directly through phishing scams fraud prevention methods like cvv and address verification service avs can stop some fraud but not all of it cvv codes are often included in stolen data dumps and retrieved from phishing campaigns while avs can be bypassed by a few minutes of online research organizations can take steps to prevent cnp fraud by implementing anti fraud tools that leverage the emv d secure payment protocol keeping e commerce tools domains and websites up to date taking down phishing sites before they harm your brand limit or block exposure to risky geographic locations verifying billing addresses through avs and credit cards with cvvs chargeback fraud chargeback fraud occurs when a customer receives the product they paid for but then initiates a chargeback with the intention to keep both their money and the item this fraud can be tough to identify because the excuse for a chargeback can vary in each case for example fraudsters can claim they never received the item or lie to card issuers by claiming they never made the purchase in the first place when chargeback fraud is done by accident it s often referred to as friendly fraud sometimes customers forget they placed an order fail to recognize a charge on their statement or think that a chargeback is another way to initiate a return either way it still hurts revenue impacts inventory and is often avoidable organizations can prevent chargeback and friendly fraud by doing the following using strong credit card verification methods to identify repeat offenders identifying fraudulent behavior through machine learning providing order confirmation emails making return policies easy to find and understand using clear transaction descriptions account takeover fraud ato fraud ato fraud happens when a criminal hijacks a legitimate customer account and uses that account to commit fraud fraudsters often attempt to make purchases drain reward points make large transfers and more ato attacks now lead to more than billion in annual loss just in the us up from this form of fraud is also tough to spot since the intruder is logging in as a verified customer account information is primarily stolen through phishing scams where victims will unknowingly attempt to log in to a malicious clone of a trusted site these sites can look indistinguishable from the legitimate company they impersonate and even redirect users to the company s real site once their information is stolen compromised accounts impact revenue but also quickly erode the trust between the customer and the brand even if the customer was careless with their account information it s up to the e commerce platform to identify ato based on behavior machine learning based risk decisioning is one of the best ways to prevent an account takeover by monitoring metrics such as geolocation session data and device id e commerce platforms can quickly identify suspicious login attempts and prevent fraud entirely organizations can prevent ato fraud by the doing the following protecting customers through risk based account monitoring supporting multi factor authentication mfa proactively taking down phishing sites before they steal your customer s data setting limits on login attempts mail interception fraud mail interception fraud occurs when a criminal uses a stolen credit card or hijacked account to make a purchase that ships to the cardholder s legitimate address once the order is placed the fraudster will quickly call customer service at the business or its shipping company to change the address or arrange for pick up at the shipping company s distribution center this technique is used to bypass address verification checks and avoid fraud detection systems luckily this type of fraud is easy to prevent by leveraging machine learning and implementing rigorous procedures for changing account information organizations can prevent mail interception fraud by doing the following using robust payment security to prevent the transaction training customer service to identify interception fraud requiring additional authentication when making changes to orders or account information account enrollment fraud why take over an account when you can use stolen card information to set up an account or rewards program with an online merchant from scratch today the volume of stolen and synthetic identity information is climbing fast with losses stemming from identity theft surging in according to aite group the federal trade commission reports that as much as of credit card fraud in the us now consists of thieves opening up new accounts in these attacks fraudsters open an account or activate a mobile app using pilfered card information since the new user appears legitimate there is no discrepancy between shipping addresses or contact information helping them bypass most traditional fraud detection systems organizations can prevent account enrollment fraud by requiring multiple forms of identity proof and running it through external databases deploying solutions that leverage machine learning and identity science to correlate and verify physical and digital identities brand impersonation brand impersonation is now implicated in of all fraud attacks worldwide brand abuse is by far the most prominent attack vector for cybercriminals due to its simplicity and effectiveness cybercriminals steal brand images company assets and register closely related domain names in order to trick unsuspecting customers brand impersonation is most prevalent in social media and email based phishing campaigns but can also be found in text messages and increasingly fraudulent brand mobile apps in these scams fraudsters leverage the stolen brand s reputation to bamboozle victims out of their money and harvest their card details brand abuse is costly to both consumers and e commerce merchants consumers stand to lose not only their money through a fake purchase but also their payment and shipping information this stolen information is typically used to perpetrate cnp fraud or is sold to others on the dark web consumers often don t understand how the attack was carried out and hold the brand responsible this loss of customer trust can lead to negative reviews and news reports that render a brand s legitimate mobile apps and email and social media communications radioactive to leery customers and prospects hobbling critical revenue channels prevention is vital when combating brand abuse as larger companies are often targeted more frequently organizations can prevent brand abuse by doing the following setting up proactive brand abuse monitoring and takedown services implementing strong email security such as dkim spf and dmarc educating staff and customers on identifying fraudulent messaging using email filtering to protect your network from phishing attacks identifying fraud in your e commerce business fraud is an evolving game of cat and mouse but by identifying the telltale signs of fraud prevention systems can be built to automatically stop new attacks here are a few risk factors that could indicate e commerce fraud new device login for an existing account unusual login location mismatched shipping billing address large purchases of the same product in a single transaction numerous separate orders placed in quick succession multiple orders to the same address with different cards the consumer is using a brand new email address to automate fraud detection merchants can leverage machine learning algorithms to identify these and other red flags how to prevent e commerce fraud identifying fraud is only half the battle it takes proactive measures to recognize high risk users and activities and prevent fraudulent transactions before they even happen let s review some steps you can take to prevent e commerce fraud define your strategy understanding your fraud and risk tolerance is key in fraud prevention for card issuers banks and merchants it s critical that each channel should have appropriate layers of protection backed by policies that balance fraud prevention and user experience in accordance with your tolerance do you throttle up fraud prevention to avoid loss at the risk of customers defecting to competitors or do you prioritize customer experience to outplay rivals while risking serious damage to your bottom line the best solutions will have strategies for each channel that stop fraud while preserving the customer experience follow pci standards following the payment card industry pci standards keep merchants in line with best data security practices and legal requirements these standards help identify weaknesses in fraud protection through self assessments and official audits conducted by qualified security assessors there are key steps that can help merchants easily achieve pci compliance install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data do not use vendor supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters protect stored cardholder data encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open public networks use and regularly update antivirus software or programs develop and maintain secure systems and applications restrict access to cardholder data on a need to know basis assign a unique id to each person with computer access restrict physical access to cardholder data track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data regularly test security systems and processes maintain a policy that addresses information security for all personnel implement layers of security throughout the perimeter and beyond there is no single foolproof solution to e commerce fraud merchants should strategically deploy layers of technology that together create a web of interconnected safeguards for instance card issuers banks payment processors and merchants should all deploy tools that enhance features built into the emv d secure ds payment standard to prevent transaction fraud using our own product as an example outseer d secure builds upon the ds standard by combining it with advanced identity science and shared intelligence from global cross industry transaction data to prevent cnp fraud merchants around the world leveraged our technology to protect more than billion in cnp transactions in just the first half of likewise merchants can leverage email standards such as dmarc help prevent phishing based brand impersonation attacks and brand abuse monitoring and takedown services like outseer fraudaction to shut down the sites as well as imposter apps and social media pages used to harvest login and payment credentials from the victims in these attacks put data

these techniques often include the following url padding smishing sms spoofing tiny urls malicious apps screen overlays advancements in mobile technology have made working shopping and entertaining ourselves via smartphone easy and convenient unfortunately scammers got the memo today fraudsters exploit both human trust and the design of mobile devices to carry out mobile phishing attacks by impersonating trusted individuals companies and brands while most people are cautious of emails many instinctively click messages on their phones and the small screens of mobile devices can make it difficult to make out sender email addresses phone numbers associated with text messages website urls and more between that and the state of remote working during the pandemic it s not surprising that mobile phishing attacks increased in according to verizon s mobile security index indeed as proofpoint reports of organizations were hit by mobile phishing attacks in with a vast majority of messages impersonating financial institutions mobile phishing can have devastating consequences resulting in data breaches stolen credentials and fraudulent money transfers costing an average of million each year for us companies and consumers they lost billion last year to brand impersonation in all its forms including mobile phishing while the average loss is some can lose much more when your customers

for years to come and despite your company s innocence consumer trust may be irrevocably lost while your brand is unfairly tarnished in social media tirades negative news reports and more let s explore some common mobile phishing techniques and outline exactly what you can do to prevent them mobile phishing techniques url padding most attacks point intended victims to phishing sites designed to look exactly like the login page of the legitimate business being impersonated url padding exploits the smaller size of mobile screens to hide malicious urls in the address bar threat actors place real trusted domains at the front of the address bar followed by hyphens to hide the true destination below is an example of a url padding attack with the true destination highlighted in bold hxxp login chase com account login confirm identity info a dot com hxxp microsoft com secureaccount confirm mlcros ft dot com while these look suspicious on their own they become a lot more convincing when loaded into a mobile browser as seen below the shorter address bar at the top hides the true destination at the end of the hyphens attackers pair url padding with a cloned version of a brand s website to steal login details and trick victims into sending money to the wrong place according to google there were new phishing websites launched every week in this year it s likely to get worse what you can do train staff to recognize these types of attacks and ensure you re using a modern browser that can alert you to this deceptive behavior browsers like google chrome will alert users to these attacks with a bright red screen and prevent the page from loading businesses can protect company owned devices by blocking malicious domains through mobile device management mdm software they can

experts in our anti fraud command center use ai and other tools to continuously monitor the threat landscape to shut down sites that impersonate your brand regardless of whether the phishing messages sent to recipients were an email or a text message tiny urls tinyurl is one of many shortening tools that helps users send shorter mobile friendly links while the service is legitimate it s also used by scammers to hide malicious links the tool works by taking a long url and replacing it with a shorter one when the user clicks the short url it redirects to the original for instance this url hxxps fakewebsite ru spyware a x installer exe would look like this hxxps tinyurl com q report the challenge here is that url shortening tools serve a real purpose but they are misused by cybercriminals fraudsters can customize shortened urls to contain a brand name or make links seem like they are part of an attachment while a majority of url shorteners attempt to monitor and stop abuse many phishing attacks slip through the cracks fraudsters use chains of multiple url redirects to evade detection from firewalls and link shortening platforms users who recognize popular url shortening tools may be tricked into a false sense of security thinking they know and trust that brand already what you can do sites like trueurl can safely reveal the end destination of a shortened link however this solution doesn t scale and isn t viable for mobile devices some artificial intelligence based solutions stop phishing messages based on context not just the presence of a malicious url alone by analyzing the link along with looking at contextual data machine learning can prevent mobile phishing attempts no matter which url shortener is used malicious apps mobile phishing attacks don t always

layers to trick users into running malware or giving the app unneeded permissions some overlays secretly record and send snapshots of your screen back to the attacker allowing them to identify contacts usernames and potentially passwords for example a bad actor can launch a screen overlay that looks exactly like your banking app when you enter your credentials that information is sent to

brand impersonation reviewing app permissions and only installing apps from official marketplaces rogue apps what they are top techniques to prevent them wondering about rogue apps we explain what they are what they do and how to protect your business and your customers from the significant damage they can cause what are rogue apps rogue apps are mobile apps designed to impersonate trusted brands with the goal of gaining unauthorized access to information that can be used to commit fraudulent transactions these malicious apps can install malware ransomware or trick users into sending their payment details to attackers fraudsters sometimes create rogue apps that simply do nothing but charge the user for the download for example cybercriminals will clone a brand s free app and simply upload it to the app store as a paid product in one recent study such fleeceware apps were collectively downloaded from the app store and google play store racking up million in revenue for fraudsters by charging subscription fees that can cost individuals as much as per year while app stores and cell phone manufacturers try to prevent the distribution and download of rogue apps it s often a cat and mouse game that can leave both brands and customers vulnerable the crime rings behind these fraudulent branded apps are growing increasingly sophisticated in one recent case a slew of different apps were used to steal the user s login credentials for banking cryptocurrency and payment apps along with email and general purpose apps the malware used to accomplish this wasn t added until after the app been downloaded and in use for some time according to outseer s own data the number of rogue mobile apps uploaded to popular app stores jumped nearly during the third quarter of and now account for of all fraud attacks worldwide what do rogue apps do rogue apps are generally used by cybercriminals to pilfer money either through fraudulent app sales or from stolen information as more app stores crack down on their upload policies cybercriminals are employing more dubious tactics for instance a malicious shopping app can detect which banking apps the victim has on their phone when they go to open one of those banking apps an exact copy of the app home screen is displayed over the real app when the victim enters their account information it is submitted to the real banking app and the criminals behind the scenes alternatively rogue apps can scare unsuspecting users into opening the door for attackers some malicious programs can display pop ups and block out portions of the screen with messages stating the device has been hacked these messages often include a download link for a cleanup tool or phone number for support the cleanup tool is typically a piece of malware that is not approved or hosted on the app store this malware can steal sensitive information to be used for further blackmail or ransom detecting these attacks can be extremely difficult when traditional security measures fail victims typically feel frustrated and often blame the impersonated brand even when the brand was unaware of the attack how do rogue apps work rogue apps can range in complexity depending on who develops them common fraudsters often create fake apps that send pop ups or display ads these pop ups usually direct the victim to a malicious site or pay the fraudster for every impression they receive organized crime and even nation states use highly sophisticated rogue apps to steal information and spy on users these attacks tend to be less frequent but are devastating once discovered entire dark web marketplaces revolve around selling exploits that criminals can use to install rogue apps without setting off any alarms in many cases these apps rely on tricking the user into handing over more permissions than needed for instance if you download a weather app it might ask for a list of permissions many people simply click yes but fail to realize they just handed over access to all of their contacts and text messages these rogue mobile apps are available from both legitimate sources such as the app store and play store as well as fake sites that mimic the looks of these trusted app repositories phishing scams and fraudulent social media pages are often used to promote these links and with the resurgence in popularity in qr codes like the one used in the super bowl the fbi is warning consumers and businesses that these d codes will be used to point unsuspecting users to these fraudulent apps once installed some of the more advanced apps go to work to hide traces of themselves it s common to see rogue apps remove their icons and disappear from the installed app list finding evidence of these apps can be tough and often requires technical experience to dig through the running background services on the device signs you re infected with a rogue app both android and ios devices can fall victim to rogue apps while the malware may vary you ll often see the same symptoms you might have a rogue app on your phone if you experience the following you re constantly seeing ads or pop ups across all your apps your battery drains faster than normal you see apps on your phone you don t recognize your app icon disappears after installation if you re experiencing one or more of these signs have your phone looked at by an expert you trust or a technician with your carrier in some cases apps can obtain system level or admin permissions to prevent themselves from being removed if this is the case reach out to an it professional as soon as possible removing rogue apps from your device consider seeking expert advice before attempting to remove any applications it s best practice to have the device looked at by a professional to verify if there is a problem and where it resides while there are numerous mobile security apps restoring your device to its factory default is the safest move complex rogue apps can sometimes clone and hide in different places inside your device simply uninstalling the app might not fully remove the infection resetting to the factory default wipes the slate clean and allows you to start from scratch again removing rogue apps from the app store businesses that find that their brand is being impersonated can contact the app store directly to remove the app the play store has a form where you can request an app removal or rejection both google and apple have very specific guidelines for developers in terms of impersonation and misleading users this removal process can take time which unfortunately leaves your customers vulnerable for longer than necessary with nearly three million apps on google play alone manually patrolling for fraudsters is impractical if not impossible if your brand is vulnerable or under attack you re advised to source a comprehensive cyberattack detection and takedown service that continuously monitors the cybercrime landscape to identify rogue mobile apps and other threats when fraud is detected an immediate takedown order is sent to the app store to ensure minimal brand damage how to defend against rogue apps rogue apps are

compliance as the minimum standard collaborating with industry peers', 'pci compliance simply defined outseer pci compliance simply defined wondering about pci compliance we explain what it is why it matters and why you must adhere to it what is pci compliance pci compliance is a requirement to meet a set of technical and operational standards for protecting credit card data pci compliance standards are set by the pci security standards council the goal of pci payment card industry compliance is to protect customer financial information as technology evolves the pci data security standard pci dss is a set of standards requiring all companies that process store or transmit credit card information to maintain a secure environment pci standards are updated and managed by the pci security standards council pci ssc the council is led by an executive committee with representatives from major credit card companies such as visa american express and discover outseer closely monitors developments in the compliance space and actively participates on the pci ssc board of advisors meeting and maintaining compliance pci dss applies to any organization that accepts transmits or stores credit card information companies must comply with these standards regardless of how many transactions they process pci compliance is not a one time assessment either it is an ongoing process that requires regular evaluations of the systems and practices organizations have in place to keep cardholder data safe pci compliance penalties the passing grade for pci compliance is meaning one missed criterion puts a business in noncompliance if a breach were to occur and the lending bank or credit card company found your organization was in noncompliance at the time you could be subject to hefty fines these fines can range from to depending on the size of your business and degree of noncompliance you could also lose your ability to accept credit card payments for several years and organizations that are monitored by the ftc may be subject to an ftc audit lastly customers who suffered a loss due to your non compliance may file lawsuits against you not only are these time consuming and expensive but they also obliterate your brand image costing you future business pci compliance levels the type of requirements your business must follow is determined by the number of transactions processed annually this means small businesses will approach pci compliance differently than an enterprise organization there are four merchant levels described by the pci ssc level merchants that process over six million card transactions annually level merchants that process one to six million transactions annually level merchants that process thousand to one million transactions annually level merchants that process fewer than thousand transactions annually to ensure that payment information is protected each level must undergo an assessment level merchants must conduct an external audit conducted by an isa internal security assessor or qsa qualified security assessor merchants between levels and can complete a self assessment questionnaire saq it s important to take your time when completing the self assessment and answer truthfully as dishonest answers can result in severe penalties if a breach occurs compliance requirements there are both technical and procedural requirements set forth by the pci ssc to meet pci compliance below are of the key requirements to meet compliance install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data do

into the pci compliance checklist we explain what the requirements of pci compliance are and how to ensure that you are compliant what is on the pci compliance checklist the requirements of pci compliance are as follows install and maintain a firewall do not use default passwords or settings protect stored cardholder data encrypt transmission of cardholder data protect against malware with antivirus software develop and maintain secure systems and applications restrict access to cardholder data assign a unique id to each person with computer access restrict physical access to cardholder data monitor all access to network resources regularly test security systems and processes maintain a policy that addresses information security why pci compliance matters pci payment card industry compliance is a set of evolving standards that aims to protect customer information and is a requirement for any organization that processes stores or transmits cardholder data pci standards are developed and maintained by the pci security standards council which is made up of stakeholders and affiliate members like amazon google and square outseer closely monitors developments in the compliance space and actively participates on the pci ssc board of advisors pci compliance is not a one time assessment either it is an ongoing process that requires regular evaluations of the systems and procedures organizations have in place to keep cardholder data safe the pci security standards council recently released version of its data security standard dss which outlines a set of comprehensive standards for organizations to follow among other things pci dss is designed to add flexibility for different methodologies and enhance validation methods what are the pci compliance penalties the passing grade for pci compliance is meaning one missed criterion puts a business in noncompliance which can result in steep fines and consequences such as the following failure to meet pci compliance can result in steep fines and consequences that include fines varying from to per month increased transaction fees suspension of the non compliant merchant account increased auditing requirements damage to brand reputation to per cardholder whose information is compromised legal costs from lawsuits settlements and judgments this can all add up fast today a data breach of any kind costs us based companies million on average per incident and it can go much higher at per cardholder for instance the capital one breach that exposed personal and payment information of million customers could cost the bank up to billion in cardholder compensation alone who enforces pci compliance pci compliance is enforced by visa amex mastercard discover and jcb international but ultimately it is up to the organization handling cardholder data to meet pci standards themselves with that said let s explore exactly what you ll need to do to meet pci compliance pci compliance checklist pci compliance doesn t have to be complicated below we ve taken each of the pci requirements and broken them down into simple actionable steps you can take to protect your customers and your business install and maintain a firewall a firewall secures your network traffic from the outside world and acts as a bridge between your internal network and the internet without a properly configured firewall attackers can enter your network and access sensitive information like cardholder data firewall solutions will range depending on your size and networking requirements many firewall vendors have a range of models that cater to small businesses and enterprises alike firewalls are useless without proper configuration which means they should be maintained by a system administrator understand what firewall policies you ll need to meet pci compliance purchase a firewall for each location that handles cardholder data create a unique username and password for admin access configure each firewall and validate its settings regularly patch and maintain the firewall to keep it secure change default passwords both hardware and software often come with default passwords upon setup while these default passwords seem convenient they leave your organization vulnerable to attack cybercriminals can crawl the internet and identify different internet facing applications with a bit of scripting attackers can test the default credentials of thousands of devices and systems accounting software wi fi routers network switches and web applications can all be vulnerable to default password attacks create a list of your hardware and software solutions audit your hardware and software for default credentials verify each user account is using a strong nondefault password maintain documentation of changes protect stored cardholder data organizations that store transmit or process cardholder data in digital or physical form must take appropriate steps to protect that data depending on your business these steps will vary for example stored cardholder data must be secured with strong encryption and truncated when viewed only retain cardholder data if authorized and necessary for business identify exactly where payment data is stored use strong and modern encryption techniques to render data unreadable use tokenization to further protect stored data restrict access to cardholder data by limiting access to encryption keys and account logins truncate or mask the primary account number when the full pan is not needed never store cardholder pins card validation codes or the full contents of a magnetic stripe or chip encrypt transmission of cardholder data similar to data storage sensitive cardholder data in transit also must be secured if left unsecured plaintext information can be stolen through a variety of attacks a common technique attackers use is called packet sniffing where a small piece of software listens across a network and copies traffic related to credit card payments if this traffic is left unencrypted attackers can easily see the contents of these packets and abuse cardholder data secure data over open or public networks such as the internet cellular data wi fi bluetooth gprs and satcom encrypt data with strong cryptography protocols such as ssl tls ssh and ipsec ensure protocols in use only support secure versions and configurations disable weak versions of protocols such as ssl v wep and tls only use trusted keys and certificates protect against malware if left unsecured your network can be vulnerable to malware that silently collects cardholder data and sends its back to the attackers who deployed it malware can enter your network through a variety of channels such as email vulnerable applications account takeover usb drives and malicious links to combat this organizations often take a layered approach to security that includes a firewall endpoint security intrusion detection and vulnerability remediation at the very minimum organizations should use business anti malware software that monitors the network and endpoints for threats in conjunction with their firewall use an email gateway to identify and block phishing scams and malicious links install business grade antivirus software on company computers and phones use intrusion detection systems that monitor the network for malicious behavior centralize your monitor efforts through threat management develop and maintain secure systems and applications pci compliance is an ongoing process that involves conducting self audits performing routine security tasks and designing new procedures a large part of staying compliant is creating policies and procedures that align with the pci standard typically organizations conduct a risk assessment and take note of all the software and hardware that involves cardholder data once listed managers can assign proper access controls audits and procedures for staff to follow this same process applies to software development patching and vulnerability remediation organizations use vulnerability scanning tools and remediation teams to ensure systems are patched and pci compliant implement a vulnerability disclosure and remediation program conduct routine self assessments and compliance audit across your systems designed policies and procedures for staff that align with pci compliance requirements install patches and hotfixes regularly and keep systems up to date restrict access to cardholder data cardholder data should only be accessible to those who absolutely need it each user should have their own username and password and never log in with a shared or generic account this is necessary for accurate auditing during a data breach or internal investigation this rule extends to physical information as well pci compliance rules state that organizations should use appropriate access controls to monitor and limit physical access to cardholder data this includes keeping records locked and secure having staff present where pci information is stored and using security measures to monitor access these steps prevent cardholder information from being stolen as well as destroyed by unauthorized persons only grant access to cardholder information to individuals that need it ensure each account has a unique username and password never use a shared or generic account leverage fraud prevention technology to stop account takeover attacks implement two factor authentication when possible conduct physical audits of locks card readers and security systems monitor access to all network resources networks provide a path to access cardholder data even when those systems appear segmented crafty attackers use various methods to gain access to network resources and computers in order to steal data impersonate staff and hijack funds a common strategy is for attackers to send phishing messages to staff that have privileged access to cardholder data these messages are designed to trick the victim into clicking a malicious link or entering their login credentials to a fake site criminals use these attacks to plant additional malware access sensitive systems and work their way deeper into more secure areas of a network use risk based account monitoring to prevent unauthorized access use a siem based tool to monitor and record network activity keep an audit of time stamped network activity for at least one year assign a staff member to review networking monitoring efforts and system reliability regularly test security systems and processes scheduled testing is crucial to maintaining pci compliance criminals are constantly looking for new loopholes unpatched systems and uninformed staff to exploit regular testing ensures the systems you put in place are working as expected and cover new devices or applications vulnerability and penetration testing as well as pci compliance scans can help you stay compliant and prioritize the issues you need to resolve first external facing domains and ip addresses must be scanned by a pci approved scanning vendor this scan might determine you need a static ip address or you need to update your tls to meet compliance your system administrator can help you meet these requirements internal vulnerability and compliance scans should also be performed quarterly perform quarterly vulnerability and pci compliance scans detect rogue access points by scanning for networks in your areas quarterly implement penetration testing standards nist sp etc deploy change detection for security configurations document how tests should be performed and what to do if there are compliance issues maintain a policy that addresses information security pci compliance should be a company wide effort with each department and team understanding their roles and responsibilities to meet compliance this security policy should educate all staff management and third parties on how your systems should be handled typically anyone with access to these systems should read and sign access requirements undergo a background check and participate in pci compliance awareness training these steps greatly reduce the risk that cardholder data will be abused or mishandled internally create a company information security policy with a pci compliance partner require staff to acknowledge and sign the policy run background checks on staff before allowing access to the company network conduct annual staff training regarding the policy review the policy annually to include any new systems or procedures defeat cybercriminals not your pci compliance policy safeguarding your pci data can feel overwhelming but with outseer you don t have to go it alone through
