INTRODUCTION
This whitepaper was conceived as a way to highlight the level of bank fraud and scam data sharing that
exists around the world. It looks at the various ways data sharing can occur:
• Banks sharing fraud and scam data among banks
• National Anti-Fraud/Scam Centers that share data between banks, the government, and other
key participants
• Vendor consortiums that share fraud signals within the vendor customer base
• Payment systems operators sharing network fraud/scam signals
• Government coordinated data sharing (e.g., MuleHunter.ai™ in India)
The whitepaper will present how these various data sharing approaches work in a number of countries,
as well as how legislation (especially privacy laws) and regulations allowing fraud and scam data
sharing are essential for data sharing to work.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Fraud and scam data sharing is probably one of the most effective tools in the fraud fighter’s tool kit to
detect and prevent fraud and scams. I remember back when I managed online security at MUFG Union
Bank up until early 2019, some of my best fraud alerts from the RSA Adaptive Authentication system
(now the Outseer Fraud Manager™) were the network fraud alerts generated from the other customers’
flagged fraud transactions. It was close to a 1:1 false positive ratio.
The best fraud and scam data sharing can help hone in on fraud and scam transactions and these can
really help to reduce the fraud losses. But a major limitation is the lack of legislation or regulation to
either allow data sharing or allow it in a meaningful way. Often, country privacy laws can limit banks
from sharing data and sometimes, something as simple as an IP addresses cannot be shared.
The good news is many countries now realize the benefits from fraud and scam data sharing. New
legislation has been passed to allow banks to share data to fight fraud and scams. Privacy laws are
being amended. There is a clear road map with best practices to share bank fraud and scam data.
The best example of data sharing comes from the UK. Banks in the UK have been sharing many types of
data for decades. They work with a number of organizations that are authorized by the UK government
to participate in data sharing. The data shared ranges from reported fraud transactions, money mules,
new account activity and even customers with reported fraud. But, even in the UK, they are working on
sharing more data.
Australia’s Financial Crimes Exchange (AFCX), established in 2016, has been at the forefront of sharing
data between banks and more recently with the National Anti-Scam Centre. The AFCX is starting to
include telecoms, crypto exchanges, digital platforms and social media companies to share critical
intelligence with banks.
For many other countries, they are in the infancy of data sharing. As you read this paper, you will see the
strong involvement of government along with the banks to use data sharing as a meaningful tool in the
fight against the fraudsters, especially in the fight to eliminate money mules. In South East Asia, we are
also starting to see regional data sharing networks evolve.
To move forward, we need to see more government involvement in the fight against fraud and
scams, which is now dominated by transnational organized crime groups or nation states. We need
to see privacy laws rewritten to allow data sharing for the explicit purpose of preventing fraud and
scam activity, along with appropriate safe harbor language to protect banks from frivolous lawsuits.
Ultimately, we want to see data sharing woven into bank fraud and scam controls—as an invisible
component of fraud and scam controls.

FRAUD AND SCAM DATA SHARING
We will first look at those countries undertaking the most data sharing, including the UK and Australia.
Then we will examine other countries including Canada, the European Union, Hong Kong, India,
Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, Thailand, and the United States.
Top Data Sharing Countries
UNITED KINGDOM
UNITED KINGDOM SUMMARY
Privacy Laws Allow banks to share fraud and scam data
Data Sharing Very robust and helped with government approved Specified
Anti-Fraud Organizations
Data Shared Fraud incidences, customers involved in fraud, beneficiary
check, and account application information
Payment Network Analysis Yes, for Faster Payment Scheme
Sharing with Telcos and Digital Platforms Yes
National Anti-Fraud/Scam Centre No
The UK financial Institutions (FIs) have been sharing fraud and scam data a number of ways for
over 30 years. The UK government allows sharing fraud data while customer data is protected under
privacy laws. FI’s do this data sharing by using a number of companies and up to six databases.
These companies include Cifas, Mastercard Vocalink, Experian and Synectics Solutions as well as at
a vendor level. In the past year, Stop Scams UK and Meta have also started data sharing programs
involving banks.

The UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA)
The UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA) do not prevent sharing personal information
where it is appropriate to do so, or from taking steps to prevent harm (preventing, detecting and
investigating scams and frauds). In fact the rationale of Legitimate Interests (Article (1)(f)) allows
sharing information about fraudsters where personal data is required to be shared.
The Serious Crime Act 2007
The Serious Crime Act 2007 (the SCA) allows the sharing of fraud data in the UK to specified anti-fraud
organizations. Data sharing must only take place within a secure framework within which individuals are
protected, in a manner that complies with the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA).
The UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) Nov 2024 Clarification For Fraud Sharing
The UK’s data protection regulator has asked banks, telecommunications providers and digital
platforms to share personal information responsibly to protect their customers from scams and fraud,
and clarified that data protection law is not an excuse for failing to do so.

The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) warned businesses that reluctance to share personal
information to tackle scams and fraud can amount to a failure to protect their users from harm, and
reassured that “data protection law does not prevent organizations from sharing personal information,
if they do so in a responsible, fair and proportionate way.”

Cifas
Over 750 organizations work with Cifas—ranging from banks, telcos, and insurers through to the public
sector and government—all benefiting from each other’s data, intelligence, and learning. Cifas is a
Specified Anti-Fraud Organization (SAFO) that began in 1988. A SAFO, under the UK Serious Crime Act
2007, can enable or facilitate the sharing of information to prevent fraud. .
Cifas has four data base services:
1. National Fraud Database
The National Fraud Database (NFD) is the most comprehensive database of fraud risk data and
intelligence in the UK. There are approximately two million records on the Database. Over 350,000
new fraud cases are currently being added yearly. This data and intelligence are shared in real
time and online: 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
The NFD hold records of first- and third-party fraud risk: facility (account) takeover, identity fraud,
false insurance claims, false applications, asset conversion and misuse of facility(which now
covers cases of money muling). Members record instances of fraudulent conduct against their
organization to the relevant database, enabling other members to search against their data. When
members confirm fraudulent conduct, they file their own case.
This database is primarily for banks, building societies, retailers, telcos, insurance public sector
2. APP Victim Check
Banks check to see if their customer, with a suspicious transaction being processed, has been a
victim of APP fraud before. Also, once a payment is confirmed APP fraud, the payment is stopped
and the customer is registered to APP Victim Check. This is particularly important due to the
nature of repeat victimization, especially against elderly victims.
3. Beneficiary Check
When a customer is doing a transaction, and it is alerted as suspicious, the bank can go to Cifas
and do a Beneficiary Check, which checks with the recipient bank to see if recipient account is
suspicious (e.g., look for indicators of fraud). If APP fraud is confirmed, transaction is blocked and
recipient account is closed as a money mule account.
4. Vision
Vision constantly monitors a bank’s customer data and sends real time alerts when the bank’s
customer fraud risk level changes. It can tell instantly if a bank customer has committed first party
fraud or money muling elsewhere, or if they’ve been a victim of fraud. This is done if the bank’s
customer data matches a case filed to the National Fraud Database (e.g., a matching phone
number or other contact data; device numbers, device IDs or IP addresses; PII documentation)
National Hunter
National Hunter operates as a not for profit anti-fraud data sharing system managed by Experian
Decision Analytics (a Specified Anti-Fraud Organization) on behalf of approximately 90 British financial
institutions. Account applications for their services will be checked before an institution decides
whether to proceed with the application.

When someone applies for financial credit and provides information to a financial institution registered
with National Hunter, their data is added to the database and compared with any previously stored
information. If a discrepancy is found, National Hunter notifies the financial institution, which then
assesses whether there are signs of potential fraudulent misrepresentation and may decide to reject
the application.
National SIRA
National SIRA (Syndicated Intelligence for Risk Avoidance) is a database of fraud, financial crime
and other risk data collated from private and public sector organizations. It is managed by Synectics
Solutions (a Specified Anti-Fraud Organization). It functions on a membership basis, with contributors
including a significant number of Tier 1, mid-size and challenger banks, and building societies. Members
report confirmed or suspicious fraud intelligence.
National SIRA has grown to become the largest syndicated database of cross-sector customer risk
intelligence in the UK, containing 300 million records from over 160 contributing members (up to 2/3rds
of banks and building societies). National SIRA is regarded by many financial institutions and insurance
companies as the default fraud detection and prevention solution. £5 billion has been saved by National
SIRA. The top three filing types include fraudulent use of an account (used to receive fraudulent funds,
fake identification, other misuse of an account), questionable applications and identity fraud.
Faster Payments and Pay.UK
Pay.UK is responsible for the management and operation of the Faster Payments Service (FPS), along
with other retail payment systems like BACS and Cheque and Credit clearing. The UK Faster Payments
Service runs on Mastercard’s Vocalink real-time payments infrastructure, enabling consumers and
businesses to make immediate payments 24x7, 365 days a year. While Vocalink operates the Faster
Payment Scheme (FPS) infrastructure, the overall scheme governance and strategic oversight are
managed by Pay.UK, which sets the rules and principles for the service.
Pay.UK recently did an anomaly detection pilot on scam transactions with three vendors using Pay.UK
network data from faster payments. The results were a 40% lift in fraud detection and a false:positive
ration of 5:1 instead of the normal 10:1. Soon, Pay.UK will start making this core service network data
available to the major banks and one or more vendors to create new solutions. This follows on from
earlier work where Vocalink with Pay.UK developed a solution to detect and shut down criminal activity
(money mules) across the Faster Payments network. The solution is called the Mule Insights Tactical
Solution (MITS) and is based on patterns of known mule transactions as the Faster Payment Network
can see both the sender and receiver side of the transaction and track transactions via network analysis.
Using network data is insightful and more payment operators should think about using this type of data.
Stop Scams UK
In 2025, Stop Scams UK announced: “Leading companies from across the technology, telecoms, and
financial sectors have pledged to come together under the banner of Stop Scams UK to drive forward
collaborative counter fraud efforts to protect consumers, build confidence, and drive UK economic
growth.“1 Stop Scams UK also said: “The first members of this initiative are, Amazon, Barclays UK, BT,
Google, HSBC, Lloyds, Nationwide Building Society, NatWest, Match Group, Meta, Monzo, Santander,
and Three and all sign a joint statement to further support Stop Scams UK’s intelligence sharing pilots.’
Stop Scams UK recently completed a proof of concept. There are two early examples of data usage:
1. Telcos will share the name and phone number involved in a suspected scam with banks. Banks
will then check their records for a match.
2. Customers will forward scam message to 7726. Telcos will receive complaint and use an AI
chatbot to continue the text conversation with the scammer to tie the scammer up.

Meta FIRE
Meta has introduced FIRE (Fraud Intelligence Reciprocal Exchange) to UK banks. The FIRE program
allows banks to share intelligence with Meta directly to combat scams on its platforms. According
to Meta, the early stage of this 6-month pilot (in 2024) has already led Meta to take action against
thousands of accounts run by scammers, with approximately 20,000 accounts removed based on data
shared.2 NatWest and Metro Bank are the first banks in the UK to participate. This shows how involving
organizations earlier in the Attack Chain can give positive preventative results.

AUSTRALIA SUMMARY
Privacy Laws Allow banks to share fraud and scam data

The recent Scam Prevention Framework (SFP) legislation, approved by Parliament in February 2025,
has a core component of data sharing. The legislation requires sharing actionable scam intelligence
amongst the sector specific participants (banks, telecom providers and digital platforms) and
the government.

Australian Financial Crimes Exchange (AFCX)
Australia has come on strong in the past three years in data sharing for fraud and scams. In 2016,
the major Australian banks launched the Australian Financial Crimes Exchange (AFCX) in partnership
with the Australian Government.3 The AFCX has the support of the Australian government’s Attorney-
General’s Department and is a key part in the Australian Government’s National Organized Crime
Response Plan.
1. AFCX Exchange
AFCX offers two main services. First is the AFCX Exchange, which involves sharing of fraud and
scam data between banks in Australia. This service was super-charged in 2024 with the addition
of the AFCX Exchange Near Real Time Intel Loop. In addition to banks, the Australian national
Anti-Scam Centre (NASC) also joined to share fraud and scam data. In an interview with ISMG, Ms.
Rhonda Lou, Head of Strategy and Engagement, discussed how the AFCX is “scaling its efforts
to stop scams by improving how telecoms, crypto exchanges, digital platforms and social media
companies share critical intelligence” with banks.4
When the Intel Loop was added, Australian Assistant Treasurer and Minister of Financial Services
Stephen Jones said: “the partnership would increase the capacity to disrupt and intercept
scammer contact with victims and help identify and take down scammer websites. The NASC will
share and receive intel such as scam phone numbers, URLs, and bank accounts that are core tools

scammers use to ply their act. This means that whether a person reports a scam to a bank, a telco
or to Scamwatch, we can use the intel loop to stop this scam from harming more Australians.”5
This quote demonstrates the strong commitment between the Australian government and the
Australian banks to share data to reduce fraud and scams.
2. AFCX Fraudulent Reporting Exchange (FRX)
The second AFCX service is the Fraudulent Reporting Exchange (FRX). According to AFCX,
the FRX is a trusted, secure, single platform which provides a more timely and efficient means
of reporting and actioning fraudulent (including scam) activities between issuing and recipient
financial institutions. FRX is basically the centralized reporting system between issuing and
recipient financial institutions on fraudulent activity. FRX includes communication with the
receiving bank in the recovery and return of funds.
National Anti-Scam Centre
Australia also has the National Anti-Scam Centre (www.nasc.gov.au) which was established in 2023.
The NASC has created partnerships between government and industry participants from the finance,
telecommunications and digital platforms sectors to tackle scams. According to the NASC, “Technology
enables NASC to ingest, analyze and share data at scale and supports collaborative strategies for scam
disruption, victim support and scam awareness across government and in partnership with industry.”
NASC is also responsible for producing the annual scam statistics for Australia.
NASC has a key focus on disrupting scams. NASC has created targeted fusion centers to focus on
specific crimes. Two recent fusion centers were investment scams and jobs and employment scams.
NASC also works with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) on the takedown
of investment scam websites. Since early 2025, ASIC and NASC have taken down over 10,000
investment scam websites. An average of 130 bogus sites are taken down weekly.

Canada’s privacy law is Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) and it
came into effect in 2004. Section 7 (added in 2015) describes when data can be shared.
Section 7 (3) Disclosure without knowledge or consent Communication
(d.1) made to another organization and is reasonable for the purposes of investigating a breach
of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province that has been, is being

According to a Canadian banking expert, Canadian Banks follow the Bank Crime Prevention and
Investigation Framework (BCPIF) as the governance model to share information with other banks for
the purpose of preventing and investigating financial crimes (e.g., fraud, money laundering). Banks
use the BCPIF governance for sharing fraud and scam data directly and indirectly. This data sharing is
allowed in cases of confirmed fraud or when a bank can prevent imminent financial crime. In consortia
data sharing, the data is often pseudonymized.

Canadian Banker’s Association (CBA)
The Canadian Banker’s Association (CBA) has developed a collaboration effort that Canadian banks
use to share fraud data between banks. Banks submit fraud cases to the CBA database. There are still
limitations on what data can be shared. An example is banks cannot share IP addresses and device IDs,
considered PII data in Canada, unless it is for confirmed fraud/scam events. Also, there are strong safe
harbor limitations for mistakes. Some types of data are shared with the CBA, who then anonymizes the
data for broader audience awareness. Banks also share specific fraud and scam intelligence data via
the CBA.

In 2024, the CBA created the Canadian Anti-Scam Alliance. According to the CBA, “the Anti-Scam
Alliance aims to drive outcomes across four priority areas in 2025:6
1. Enhancing cross-sector data and intelligence sharing (with banks, telcos, digital platforms,
Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre and law enforcement). Sharing of confirmed bad actor data is
permissible and is the current focus of the Alliance for piloting a project between financial
institutions and telecom providers. The goal is to work toward a centralized platform to pull/push
data to/from. An industry expert advised me that there are barriers (e.g., privacy, legal risks, and
data handling security), both real and perceived, that currently limit the sharing of some data.
2. Strengthening Canada’s anti-scam technology and security capabilities
3. Digital platform engagement
4. Public education and awareness
The Canadian Anti-Scam Alliance has looked to identify clear use cases for sharing data across sectors
in a way that is equitable for participants. This included aligning on what is permissible within Canada’s
privacy laws, identifying high impact use cases and relevant data attributes that can be provided by
various sectors. This group is also examining technology and security mechanisms for sharing data
across sectors in a privacy enhancing manner.
Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (CAFC)
Canada has a national anti-fraud centre called Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (CAFC). CAFC is a national
police service that gathers intelligence on fraud across Canada and assists Police of Jurisdiction with
enforcement and prevention efforts.
The CAFC maintains the Fraud Reporting System (FRS), a centralized database pooling fraud
reports from individuals, businesses, and financial institutions. CAFC provides information to law
enforcement and governments in Canada and around the world. CAFC’s goals include: disrupting
crime, strengthening the partnership between the private and public sectors and maintaining Canada’s
economy. CAFC works with internation law enforcement, including the US Secret Service on a number
of cases. CAFC will also takedown bogus investment web sites to prevent scams.

Like most countries the EU has strong privacy laws that restrict sharing of customer data. This has
made any fraud data sharing problematic. In 2024, the European Banking Authority, in its April 2024 EBA
Opinion on new types of payment fraud and possible mitigants, recommended:
A requirement for all Payment Services Providers (PSPs) to share fraud related information among
themselves to enhance transaction monitoring. In this regard, the provisions in Art. 83 of the
Payment Services Regulation (PSR) could be further strengthened by requiring all PSPs to share
fraud related data, limited not only to unique identifiers/IBANs of the payee, but also including
aspects such as other identification elements of persons suspected to be fraudsters (including
names, IP addresses and phone numbers used) and information on the fraudsters’ modus
operandi.7
The EU fraud and money laundering laws can now be construed as beginning to allowing fraud data
sharing in the EU. Payment Services Regulation (PSR) from PSD3 allow sit for fraud, and complementary
to it is the Anti-Money Laundering Regulation (AMLR) for money laundering and terrorist financing.
PSD3 is still in draft state but should be released in 2026, while the AMLR will come into force in
July 2027.”
There may still need to be discussions with the EU’s Data Protection Authority (DPA) to confirm fraud
data sharing will be allowed soon in the EU.

EBA Clearings
EBA Clearings, the manager of two payment systems in the EU has a network anomaly direction system,
called Fraud Pattern and Anomaly Detection (FPAD).8 By using network data, EBA Clearings has created
a very effective tool that offers “a unique network view of insights into payment and beneficiary account
behaviors unavailable to any single PSP (Payment Service Provider).”
National Level
Individual EU countries have National Anti-Fraud/Scam Centers. Belgium is one example. Its national
center is called the Centre for Cybersecurity Belgium (CCB). It was established in 2014. The CCB also
plays a key role in the realization of Belgium’s Cybersecurity Strategy 2.0, which was approved by the
country’s National Security Council in 2021.
One program CCB has is called the Belgian Anti-Phishing Shield (BAPS). It is a way for consumers to
report fraud web sites. Plus, there is a special API path for trusted partners to report these fraud web
sites. The Centre then gets ISPs to take down the sites. Then a warning page is put up for consumers.

One of the CCB’s most successful initiatives is Safeonweb.be, a public awareness platform that has
quickly become the national reference for cybersecurity. Citizens actively contribute to cybersecurity
through this portal, reporting suspicious emails (up to 10 million per year) to suspect@safeonweb.be.
The Safeonweb.be website and app provide up-to-date information on current scams, phishing trends,
and practical advice for consumers.
The cybersecurity framework created by the CCB, known as the Cyber Fundamentals, has garnered
international attention and is currently being adopted by countries like Romania and Ireland.
In the Netherlands, the equivalent of a national anti-scam center is the Stichting Aanpak Financieel-
Economische Criminaliteit in Nederland (Foundation for Tackling Financial-Economic Crime in the
Netherlands) or SAFECIN. SAFECIN has a unit called fraudehelpdesk.NE, which is the Dutch national

The Royal Malaysian Police (PDRM) has introduced the Semak Portal version 2.0 to curb the
commercial crime of online fraud in the country.12 This is a program, which began in 2018, is used by
consumers before they do financial transactions to check phone numbers and bank accounts to see if
they have been reported as fraud. The Semak Mule Portal has so far also listed 193,000 mule accounts
and 164,000 phone numbers used by scammers. Some 27.2 million visitors have searched in to the
portal, and about 1.9 million of the searches have been positive, meaning transactions to mule accounts
were prevented. This is an innovative use of data sharing directly with the consumers.
National Scam Response Centre (NSRC)
Malaysia has a national anti-scam center, called the National Scam Response Centre (NSRC),

• Fund (account) freezing rates increased from 0.5% to 30%
• Reduced time to investigate (fraudulent funds) by 75% to 30 minutes
• 14% improvement in mule detection
As part of the NSP, the financial industry has also agreed to adopt industry-wide procedures for
reporting and handling mule accounts. The NSRC also identifies and analyzes various types of scams.
In March 2025, the NSRC was planning to add almost 140 staff.

is to mitigate victims’ losses through the swift interdiction of the proceeds of crimes.” Staff from the
six major banks are co-located at the ASC. The ACS collaborates with more than 80 stakeholders
comprising financial institutions, fintech companies, telcos and online marketplaces. The Singapore
Police Force can freeze bank accounts suspected of being involved in scam activities within a day.
More importantly, the center involves telco and digital platform cooperation such as telecommunication

(TBA) and the Bank of Thailand. The registry platform lets banks prevent suspected accounts from
completing transactions based on an artificial intelligence system.
In 2024, the TBA introduced data-sharing through the CFR. One of the main purposes of this data base
is to identify and crack down on money mule accounts. Since the introduction of the CFR system, the
banking sector has identified 15,000 individual depositors linked to mule accounts. Every bank has
established internal procedures to address fraudulent accounts, such as immediately closing such
accounts and prohibiting depositors from reopening new accounts.
There is the establishment of the Center for Prevention and Suppression of Technology Crimes.
This Center will notify financial institutions and business operators of names or digital asset wallet
addresses that may be related to technology crimes, triggering an obligation to suspend the accounts.
This extends data sharing from banks to Crypto platforms to track the money mules there.

UNITED STATES SUMMARY
Privacy Laws Current US privacy laws limit data sharing
Data Sharing Very limited data sharing, primarily under FinCEN 314 (b)
and some bank-to-bank data sharing
Data Shared Financial Institutions may share information relating to
activities that a financial institution suspects may involve
possible terrorist financing or money laundering, including
fraud.

Sharing with Telcos and Digital Platforms No
National Anti-Fraud/Scam Centre No
goVERNmENT AuTHoRITY To SHARE FRAud dATA
The United Stated has been limited in fraud data sharing because of the US Treasury Financial Crimes
Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and strict US privacy laws. FinCEN is responsible for AML/BSA in the
US. There is a 314(b) program for sharing AML data, which includes fraud data. Fraud data is defined as
a Specifically Unlawful Activity (SUA) and can be included in 314(b) data sharing.
So, first what is 314(b)? According to the FinCEN Section 314(b) Fact Sheet in 2020, “314(b) of the USA
PATRIOT Act provides financial institutions with the ability to share information with one another, under
a safe harbor that offers protections from liability, in order to better identify and report activities that
may involve money laundering or terrorist activities, included in the list of SUAs.”20
The information that can be shared pursuant to 314(b): Specifically, financial institutions or an
association of financial institutions sharing information under the safe harbor created by Section 314(b)
may share information relating to activities that a financial institution or association suspects may
involve possible terrorist financing or money laundering. This may occur, for instance, when the financial
institution or association is sharing information about specific transactions involving the proceeds
of one or more SUAs. The SUAs include an array of fraudulent and other criminal activities, including
fraud against individuals, organizations, or governments, computer fraud and abuse, and other crimes.
A financial institution or association may share information on attempts to induce others to engage in
transactions, such as in a money mule scheme. 314 (b) is voluntary for financial institutions.
Since 314(b) was established in 2002, there have been no changes. And according to industry experts,
none are planned. These experts said if it became mandatory for banks to share SUA data and there
were defined response times to queries, that could help make 314(b) a better fraud data sharing tool.

FRAud dATA SHARINg oRgANIZATIoNS
There are a number of initiatives under way exploring ways to share data between banks and
other organizations.
Financial Services information and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC)
The US Financial Services information and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC), a member consortium of financial
institutions focused on cyber risks, has expanded its member-to-member data sharing into the fraud
space over the past few years. Recently, it published a member-built Cyber Fraud Prevention Framework
to show how the two sides can come together to protect consumers.
American Bankers Association
In late 2023, The American Bankers Association announced they are creating an information-sharing
exchange that member banks will be able to use to get the names and account information of
suspected scammers almost in real time.21 This pilot is continuing in 2025. The ABA also has the ABA
Fraud Contact Directory which helps banks easily connect with other institutions to resolve fraudulent
transfers.22
National Task Force on Fraud and Scam Prevention
There is no National Anti-Fraud Center (and no national fraud/scam strategy either). In 2024, the US
non-profit Aspen Institute convened a number of banks, digital platforms, telecom providers and Law
Enforcement to discuss how the US can finally get into the scam fight. And there are discussions at
these meetings about a National Anti-Fraud Center and data sharing. By year-end, The Aspen Institute
will have recommendations and hopefully a real action plan with meaningful financial commitments
from the participants.
The Aspen Institute launched the National Task Force on Fraud and Scam Prevention, which is a
cross-sector effort to tackle consumer fraud and scams in the US. One of its work streams is titled
”Information Sharing Across Sectors.” Members of this task force are from financial institutions, digital
platforms, government, telcos and consumer groups. Actionable recommendations are due by year
end 2025.
Nation Elder Fraud Coordination Center (NEFCC)
One bright spot on the US data sharing horizon, is the newly formed Nation Elder Fraud Coordination
Center (NEFCC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. NEFCC primary goal for the next year is to work with law
enforcement and private enterprise to share specific elder scam data points that will allow dozens
of lower value individual scam cases to be aggregated into larger cases for law enforcement and
Department of Justice attorneys/District Attorneys to work to bring criminals to justice. Brady Finta, the
head of NEFCC, described in an interview the data NEFCC will collect from various sources as selectors,
or signals. These selectors include phone numbers, email addresses, wire transfers, digital currency
accounts and IP addresses. These selectors will help tie smaller cases into one large case, which then
supports the prosecution of these large cases and put criminals in jail.
The Financial Data Exchange (FDX)
For Open Banking, The Financial Data Exchange (FDX), an international, nonprofit technical standards
body) has an API that allows for sharing of fraud and scam data that Open Banking participants can use
to share data.

Federal Reserve
In 2024, there was a Federal Reserve working group on scam information data sharing.23 They issued a
report. In the report they defined the problem:
Stakeholders in the U.S. payments industry lack real-time access to current, industrywide
information necessary to develop effective strategies to detect and prevent a growing number of
scams, and other fraud types, that cause significant financial losses and negatively impact both
consumers and organizations.
The working group “recommended the industry consider establishing an information exchange to
provide scam intelligence across payment rails.”
To be fair, there are some fraud fighters in the US that say that there is enough permission to share
fraud and scam data in the US. This sharing may be done privately between banks or with private
organizations with versions of 314(b) solutions. Some vendors also offer 314(b) versions of data
sharing in the US.
Because the US privacy laws are so stringent and the US is a very litigious country, US financial
institutions will continue to be quite conservative and limit fraud and scam data sharing.
Regional Data Sharing
In the April 2025 UN report Inflection Point: Global Implications of Scam Centres, Underground Banking and
Illicit Online Marketplaces in Southeast Asia, the UN called for more sharing of data on a regional basis:24
Cross-border cooperation is essential to address the transnational nature of scam operations
and associated criminal infrastructure. Collective efforts can help prevent displacement, share
intelligence, and support enforcement across jurisdictions.
Mechanisms for timely information exchange and operational coordination should be reinforced
at bilateral and regional levels. Regional platforms offer a basis for joint investigations and
collaboration on high-priority cases.
Shared research and typology development to improve situational awareness and guide risk-
based responses. Engagement with multilateral frameworks strengthens mutual legal assistance
and supports coordinated approaches beyond the region.
Several of South East Asian countries are already talking about sharing fraud and scam data regionally.
Consortium Data Sharing
Perhaps some of the best shared bank data comes from consortiums. Consortiums are somewhat
removed from the constraint of privacy laws, as long as the PII data is well protected and even
anonymized in some cases. The False:Positive ratios on consortium data can typically be much better
than on non-consortium data. Consortium data can be a great way to identify money mule accounts.
Outseer has its own consortium solution, called Outseer Global Data Network.25 The Network “gathers
daily signals from millions of transactions marked as fraudulent across thousands of the largest
financial institutions worldwide. Outseer continuously monitors and tracks fraud activity across an
extensive network of financial institutions, card issuers, and issuing processors. When a network
member marks an activity as fraudulent in the case management application, the associated signals are

shared across the network.” When I used this Network from 2007–2019, the false:positive ratio on alerts
were always my best false:positive ratios from alerts I was receiving.
Other vendors also have consortium data sharing that can involve 314 (b) programs and sharing
between sending and receiving banks.
Other Data Sharing
GLOBAL ANTI-SCAM ALLIANCE (GASA)
In 2024, GASA, a non-profit organization committed to fighting online scams, announced the Global
Signal Exchange (GSE).26 The GSE is a collaborative initiative designed to fight the growing problem of
online scams, fraud, and DNS abuse through data sharing. Together, this partnership aims to empower
the global community in combating scams more effectively and significantly reduce their impact on
society. Google and the DNS Research Federation (DNSRF)
This collaboration brings together Google’s data, funding and AI capabilities, DNSRF’s cutting-edge
technology, and GASA’s global network of stakeholders. The aim to turn the tide on scams by sharing
data openly and taking swift action. There are now governments and four major tech companies
contributing to the GSE.
Here are some recent successes from the GSE project:
• In a historic handshake, Google exchanged threat signals with Meta through the GSE. Meta reported
that the signals were nearly 100% accurate and actionable, and moreover were new to Meta. Meta
was able to use the signals to refine its own AI models for fighting scams and fraud
• Google reports that the GSE has reduced its onboarding of new signals sources from six months–
two years down to two weeks. This helps to make the fight against scams and fraud more efficient.
• The GSE is working on a pilot project with the advertising industry to help share and identify
suspected malvertising links.
BANKS AND TELCOS DATA SHARING
In a number of countries, banks and telcos are working together to identify use cases where data
sharing makes sense. Here are a few examples
1. The GSMA, a telco organization that unites over 1000 mobile operators and businesses across
the ecosystem and related industries to advance innovation, and UK Finance, who represents over
300 financial services firms in the UK, worked together to “provide a collaborative framework for
the UK’s leading mobile network operators and banks to develop and launch Scam Signal, a new
solution to help address Authorized Push Payment (APP) fraud in the UK.” This solution helps tell
a bank if a customer is on a live call while doing a banking transaction.27
2. GSMA has now created a whole set of APIs focused on security and anti-fraud measures,
called Camara.28 In addition to ‘Scam Signal’, other examples of these APIs include SIM Swap
information, number verification and device status. These APIs are available from mobile
operators around the world.

3. Australian banks have been working with telcos to better identify text messages. The SMS Sender
ID register will be implemented in 2025 to help reduce bank impersonation scams.
PAYMENT NETWORK DATA
Payment network data can be most important because it can see both the sending and receiving bank
information. In 2025, Mastercard announced a new network-agnostic solution, TRACE, “to proactively
identify money mules and trace the dispersion of funds.” This is based on the work Mastercard does for
the UK Faster Payment network, the first network to use TRACE. This can help more payment networks
provide network anomaly detection around money mules.
Mastercard announced the second network to use TRACE
“Mastercard’s first Asia Pacific rollout of TRACE was in the Philippines in collaboration with local
interbank network BancNet (the switch operator of local RTP service InstaPay), with BancNet
having already onboarded 36 domestic banks. The solution allows participating financial
institutions to quickly and extensively trace dispersed illicit funds across the RTP system,
identify money mule activity throughout the network, and proactively highlight suspected money
laundering accounts.”

CONCLUSION
Data sharing is ever so important. And there are so many ways data can be effectively shared to
fight the scammers, subject to government regulation and privacy laws. Often, we have seen it take
government legislation to allow proper bank fraud and scam data sharing. In this white paper we have
looked at a number of ways bank fraud and scam data can be shared:
• Banks sharing data between themselves.
• Banks sharing data with a third party set up to be an approved/regulated data repository.
• Banks sharing data with national anti-scam centers and vis versa
• Vendors creating data consortiums within its customer base.
• Payment network operators using internal network data.
• Countries sharing fraud and scam data within a geographic region.
Yet, in many countries, bank fraud and scam data sharing is quite limited or non-existent. The US is one
of those countries. What is so impressive is the number of countries moving forward with bank data
sharing, especially in the UK, Australia, and Southeast Asia.
Banks sharing fraud and scam data, including money mule account information, really makes a difference
in the fight against scams. This is also true with vendor consortiums that can have some of the best data
to identify and block fraud/scam transactions. And it is so impressive that Malaysia has a program for
consumer to directly check phone and bank account data, before they execute a transaction.
It may be that some of the best fraud and scam data sharing comes from vendor consortiums
and ‘network’ detection solutions embedded within the network. In future the ISO20022 standard
for electronic data interchange between financial institutions will allow different vendors to cross
collaborate in real time before transactions are sent.
