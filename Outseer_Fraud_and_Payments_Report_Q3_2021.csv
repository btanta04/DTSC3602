Fraud Attack
Trends
Digital transformation is reshaping nearly every facet
of our lives – how we live, how we shop and who we
trust. As new digital models scale, organizations
must be prepared for the potential risks and
challenges that may come with them.
Based on data analyzed by the Outseer Data
Science and Research teams, a number of notable
fraud activities have been identified across attack
vectors and spanning all digital channels.
By tracking and reporting the volume and regional
distribution of these fraud threats, Outseer seeks to
help build awareness about the current state of
cybercrime and advance the conversation about
combating it more effectively.

Digital Banking &
Payments Trends
Outseer researchers analyze digital banking & payments fraud
trends to inform security and risk management decisions at
major organizations. These efforts also serve the public interest
by identifying, preventing, or reducing financial cyber fraud
attacks targeting consumers. Observing these trends over time
can help decision-makers determine how best to build or refine
their digital risk management strategies across customer-facing
digital channels and digital payments.
This data is intended to broadly frame the current consumer
fraud environment and identify relevant trends by tracking broad
indicators of digital fraud across both financial and e-commerce
focus areas.

Changes in the value of transactions might be attributable to adoption of
